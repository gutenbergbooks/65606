<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>The story of the exiled Queen of Naples, Maria
Sophia, as the title-page of this little volume
sets forth, is the story of a &ldquo;forgotten
heroine.&rdquo; In many respects it recalls the story of
her sister, Elizabeth of Hungary, though her fate
was not so tragic. She was saved from the fury
of the assassin; but she revealed many of her
sister&rsquo;s attributes&mdash;the same courage, the same
beauty, the same gayety of disposition, clouded in
much the same manner, the same love of nature and
of animals, the same love of the people, the same
domestic misfortunes. Her comparatively brief sovereignty
included a thrilling period of the struggle
for Italian unity. Her marriage was a brilliant one,
her honeymoon most strange, and her after life most
lonely. She was a strong woman united to a weak
man, not of her choice and not honored by her love.
She had many faults, but of her heroism the siege of
Gaeta will always bear witness. The other figures
in the story, the fascinating Lola Montez, Count
Cavour, the great statesman, King Victor Emanuel,
King &ldquo;Bomba,&rdquo; and the red-shirted Garibaldi, add
to its picturesqueness, and the manners and customs
of the court of Bavaria as well as the sketches of
the Wittelsbachs are not without historic interest.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The House of Wittelsbach</span></h2>
<p>The house of Wittelsbach, one of the most
ancient of the royal families of Europe, was
divided, toward the end of the eighteenth
century, into three branches. The old Elector, Karl
Theodore, who died in 1799, was without issue, and
his successor, Maximilian of the Pfalz-Zweibr&uuml;cken
line, became the founder of a new dynasty. Being
the third son, there had seemed little prospect of
succeeding to the throne in his earlier years, most
of which were spent in the strictest seclusion at
Mannheim and Zweibr&uuml;cken. Later, he entered the
French army and until the outbreak of the French
Revolution was stationed as colonel at Strassburg,
where the jovial warrior made himself most popular,
not only in military but in social circles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>In 1785 he was married to Princess Augusta of
Hesse-Darmstadt, by whom he had two sons, Ludwig
(his successor) and Karl, and three daughters,
one of whom died in childhood. Augusta, the
second, married Eugene Beauharnais, while Charlotte,
the youngest, became the fourth wife of Emperor
Francis the First of Austria. Maximilian&rsquo;s first
wife died early, and in 1796 he formed a second and
equally happy alliance with the Princess Caroline
of Baden, who presented him with six daughters, of
whom three became queens of Saxony and Prussia,
and the two youngest, the mothers of Emperor
Francis Joseph of Austria and the Empress Elizabeth,
respectively.</p>
<p>The branch of the Wittelsbachs to which Maximilian
belonged was divided into two lines, both
descending from the Count Palatine, Christian the
First. A cousin, the Count Palatine Wilhelm of
Zweibr&uuml;cken-Birkenfeld, had hopes of securing the
Electoral seat at Munich for himself, especially as
ancient tradition required that a portion of the
domain should fall to the share of the younger branch
of the family. As Wilhelm had but one child, however,
a son who was feeble-minded and under constant
guardianship, an agreement was made between
the cousins that in future there should be no division
of the Wittelsbach possessions. Maximilian was to
succeed to the Electorship of Bavaria undisturbed,
in return for which the reigning sovereign was to
treat the descendants of Count Wilhelm as his own.
The younger branch was to rank equally with the
older and to receive a large share of the ancestral
possessions, with a handsome yearly income and
the title of &ldquo;Dukes in Bavaria.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>In accordance with this agreement, Maximilian
became Elector of Bavaria, which was raised by
Napoleon to the dignity of a kingdom in 1806, and
in 1818 granted a constitution by its sovereign.
Maximilian was much beloved by his subjects and
so simple and patriarchal in his dealings with them
that he was generally known as the &ldquo;Citizen King.&rdquo;
On his birthday, October 12, 1825, he was present
at a ball given in his honor by the Russian ambassador,
full of life and vigor as usual, and the next
morning was found dead in his severely simple bedchamber
at Schloss Nymphenburg.</p>
<p>Duke Wilhelm of Birkenfeld long survived him,
and it now devolved upon the new King, Ludwig the
First, to carry out the family compact. Meanwhile
Wilhelm&rsquo;s son, Duke Pius, had also died, leaving
one son, Duke Max. Almost from the birth of this
prince it had been decided that he should marry
King Maximilian&rsquo;s youngest daughter Ludovica, who
was born the same year, and on the ninth of September,
1828, the marriage was duly celebrated, three
months before the bridegroom had reached his
twentieth year. Although dictated by family reasons,
this marriage proved a remarkably happy one.
The two young people had grown up together, knowing
that they were to be united for life, and were
sincerely attached to each other. Their honeymoon
was spent in the Bavarian Alps with Ludovica&rsquo;s
mother, the widowed Queen Caroline, at her
Summer home at Tegernsee. At the time of the
King&rsquo;s death, two of the daughters were still unmarried
and the constant companions of their
mother, to whom they were devoted, and Ludovica&rsquo;s
marriage made no change in their life except that
a son-in-law was added to the family circle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Duke Max at that time was called the handsomest
prince in Europe. He was slender and well
built, with a distinguished ease of manner and a
graciousness that won the hearts of all with whom
he came in contact, regardless of class or station.
Naturally gay and light-hearted, fond of pleasure
and society, an accomplished musician and composer,
with a passion for nature and out-of-door life,
it is small wonder that he was universally adored.
Even his mother-in-law, to whose age and habits
his lack of seriousness did not at first especially
appeal, was completely won by his devotion to her
and her daughter, and his constant efforts to divert
and entertain them. When the famous violinist,
Paganini, came to Munich, Max invited him to visit
the castle at Tegernsee and sent one of the royal
carriages to meet him. He often arranged amateur
concerts, to which all the neighboring families were
invited, and whiled away the long Autumn evenings
playing and singing with his friend Petzmacher, the
zither-player.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Ludovica was very different from her husband.
She disliked meeting people, cared nothing for social
life or gayety, and had an abhorrence for noise or
confusion of any kind. Max was a great admirer
of the fair sex and made no concealment of the fact.
He had the true artist nature, sanguine, impulsive,
and susceptible, and must have caused the Duchess
many unhappy hours, innocent as most of the
love affairs attributed to him seem to have been.
Whatever her feelings were, however, she carefully
concealed them from the eyes of the world.
To all appearances the relations between her and
her husband were most harmonious. In many ways,
too, their opposite temperaments were of mutual
advantage. His cheerfulness and careless gayety
often banished the fits of melancholy to which she
was subject, while her firmness and good sense
proved a balance to his volatile nature, and they
were united in their love of nature and country life.</p>
<p>The first three years of their marriage were childless,
but in 1831 the Duchess presented her husband
with an heir, who was named Ludwig, for the King.
As time went on the family circle increased. The
oldest daughter, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, was born in 1834. On
Christmas Eve of 1837, Elizabeth came into the
world, followed, in the Summer of 1839, by a second
son, Karl Theodore. On the fourth of October, 1841,
at Possenhofen, the Duchess gave birth to her third
daughter, Maria Sophia Amalia, the future Queen
of Naples. Two years later, Mathilde Ludovica
was born. On the twenty-second of February,
1847, the youngest daughter of the ducal pair,
Sophie Charlotte Augusta, made her appearance at
Munich, and on the seventh of December, 1849,
their youngest son, Maximilian Emanuel was born,
also in Munich.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Nearly all these children were destined to bring
sorrow or anxiety to their parents. The Duke&rsquo;s
mercurial nature helped him to bear and rise
above these troubles, but they sank deep into
Ludovica&rsquo;s heart. But she was sustained by her
religion and a firm faith in Providence, whose decrees
she bore with dignity and patience. Little as she
spoke of it, devotion to her children was the ruling
passion of her life. She never was diverted, by any
consideration, from what she felt to be her duty
toward them; and while her methods of training did
not bear equal fruit with all, they loved her devotedly
in return and always regarded her with the deepest
respect and confidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Life at Munich and Possenhofen</span></h2>
<p>Up to the end of the first half of the last century
intellectual and artistic development had
made little progress in Bavaria. Weimar
had become famous as the home of Goethe and
Schiller, Herder and Wieland, but Munich was still
merely a provincial town, not so large by half as it
is to-day, while the many gardens scattered about
among the houses gave it an almost rustic air. The
population consisted chiefly of artisans, with a few
wealthy citizens, the students of the university, and
court <i>attach&eacute;s</i>. Visitors to the capital at that time
were few. Of social life, so called, there was practically
none, and the free mingling of all classes in
public places suggested Italian popular life, especially
after King Ludwig&rsquo;s plans for beautifying the
city had begun to attract thither artists of all countries
and ages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>With the kings of Bavaria, however, a new order
of things was instituted. Ludwig the First, who
succeeded Maximilian, was far ahead of most German
princes of his time in learning and culture.
In early youth he had made himself conspicuous
by his hatred of Napoleon, although the conqueror
had been his father&rsquo;s friend and ally. At the Congress
of Vienna, Talleyrand had called him a clever
madman, and he had been laughed at for his
intense enthusiasm over everything pertaining to
Germanism. His frequent sojourns in Rome were
destined to be of the greatest importance to the
art life of Germany, for, on ascending the throne, he
swore to make his capital a city of such prominence
that &ldquo;no one should know Germany who had not
seen Munich&rdquo;; and to his honor be it said that he
not only kept this vow, but did so with comparatively
small means at his command. Thanks to
his zeal and energy the finances of the country were
soon in excellent condition. Most economical as to
his own personal expenses, he devoted large sums
to the purchase of rare treasures for the art collections
he had planned for his capital, and employed
a number of distinguished artists and architects to
beautify the city, which now possesses many imperishable
reminders of this art-loving sovereign.</p>
<p>Few royal houses of the present day can furnish
examples of such harmony and attachment between
different branches of the family as that of Wittelsbach
exhibited. The relations between King Ludwig
and Duke Max were always most affectionate,
and the brothers-in-law had many tastes and characteristics
in common. Both were full of originality
and energy, and both had a genuine love of art, the
King having a great fondness for painting and poetry,
while Max devoted himself principally to music. It
was Ludwig the First who instituted the famous
artist balls in Munich, which he and the Duke rarely
failed to attend, and there was seldom a concert
given at the Academy of Music where both royal
and ducal families were not to be seen seated in the
dress circle just behind the orchestra. However
pressing the affairs of state, the King never failed
to take part in the many religious festivals observed
by the Church, and on All Saints&rsquo; Day he invariably
made a visit to the cemetery accompanied by all his
relatives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>While Ludwig was busy erecting his magnificent
public edifices, Max employed himself building and
rebuilding palaces. Possenhofen, where most of his
children were born, was the favorite residence both
of himself and his family, although they usually
spent the Winters in Munich; and here, in the years
1833-1835 the celebrated architect, Leo von Klenze,
built for them a magnificent residence in the Ludwigstrasse.
Rank and state, however, by no means
excluded simple kindliness and true hospitality from
the splendid halls of the Duke and Duchess. They
frequently gave large balls which were eagerly
looked forward to by the younger set in the aristocratic
world of Munich. Duke Max always stood
by the door to welcome his guests on these occasions,
offering each lady a bouquet of flowers with
true knightly gallantry. Fountains plashed in the
huge ballroom where inviting seats were placed here
and there among groups of splendid foliage plants,
while from behind a leafy screen floated the strains
of an orchestra inviting to the dance. All chatted,
laughed, and danced with perfect unconstraint, and
the Duke was always the gayest of the gay, with
the right word for every one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>During Lent the Duke and Duchess issued invitations
for a series of concerts. Again the spacious
rooms were turned into gardens. Comfortable
chairs were arranged among masses of rose-bushes,
and during pauses in the music refreshments were
served and the guests promenaded about conversing
gayly. It was never crowded, never too warm or
too cool, in these splendid salons, and Duke Max&rsquo;s
entertainments were counted as the choicest pleasures
of the Winter.</p>
<p>In the great courtyard of the palace he had a ring
made where exhibitions of fancy riding were given
before the ladies of the family and a few invited
guests, Max himself often taking part. This became
the favorite resort of his daughters in Winter, who
would spend whole days there exercising, with their
dogs and horses for companions, and it was here
that Elizabeth of Austria and Maria Sophia of
Naples acquired the skill that afterward made them
the most perfect horsewomen of their day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Properly to classify a plant it is necessary to
study the soil that has nourished it. That from
which the Wittelsbach sisters sprung was Bavarian,
of course, but more accurately speaking, the region
about Possenhofen and Starnberg Lake, whither the
family repaired every year with the first signs of
Spring. The shores of Starnberg are fringed with
castles, among them the solitary Schloss Feldafing,
whence King Ludwig the Second flung himself into
the waters of the lake. Back of these are many
small villages interspersed with villas built by artists
from Munich. Between lie stretches of dark pine
forest or clumps of lighter beeches, their branches
drooping over the surface of the water, while as a
background to this entrancing scene rise majestic
mountain peaks. Possenhofen was known in the
twelfth century as &ldquo;Pozzo&rsquo;s Hof.&rdquo; In the fifteenth
it was presented by the Palatine Friedrich von
Scheyern-Wittelsbach to a neighboring convent, but
later it came into the possession of the Elector Ferdinand
Maria of Bavaria, a peace-loving prince,
who made Starnberg Lake the scene of many splendid
<i>f&ecirc;tes</i>. In 1834 Duke Max bought the castle,
had the outer wall and vaulted gateway torn down
and the moat filled in, thus making room for the
large gardens that now surround Possenhofen. Outwardly
the building was allowed to retain its original
form, but the interior was completely changed. Four-post
bedsteads, huge antique stoves, and chests of
olden days were replaced by modern furniture and
conveniences. An additional wing or two made
room for guests, and a chapel was built, connecting
the ancient edifice with its newer parts. The castle
courtyard and gardens are still surrounded by a
high wall, extending along the shore of the lake, and
this with the old towers forms the last link with
those days when Pozzo&rsquo;s Hof served not only as a
residence for its noble masters, but also as a stronghold
against the enemies of the prince and people.
Inside the wall rises the huge pile of reddish yellow
stone, its whole eastern side covered with a natural
mantle of ivy, making an attractive picture against
the fresh green of the park and the gardens, with
their flower-beds and fountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Duke Max and his family may be said to have
grown up with this beautiful spot. Here he brought
his bride one bright summer morning; here they
spent their happiest days together, far from the
burdensome restrictions of court etiquette; here
their children received their first impressions of life;
and hither they always returned with a feeling of
joy and comfort no other place could offer. The
young princesses spent long days riding and swimming,
training their dogs and horses, or clambering
about on the mountain tops. It was this life in the
open air that stamped them with so marked an individuality
and gave them their love of freedom and
simplicity. They were quite at home among the
country folk and deeply resented any slight or injury
to their mountain friends. In this, however, they
merely followed the example set them by their
parents. The beautiful home at Possenhofen had
roots stretching far out into the countryside, and
all who were in trouble hastened at once for help
and comfort to Duchess Max, whose womanly sympathies
were by no means confined to her own family
circle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Her handsome husband was even more popular,
and his gay good nature and easy charm of manner
made him adored by all. He was passionately fond
of hunting, and spent whole days tramping about
through the mountains alone with his gun. One
evening after a long chase he arrived at a small
tavern, tired and hungry, and his shabby old hunting
clothes soiled and torn. No one recognizing him,
he seated himself by the fire, took out his zither, and
began to play. Some wood-cutters were so pleased
with the stranger&rsquo;s music that they offered to pay
him if he would play a few peasant dances for them.
Max cheerfully agreed, and played and sang till
the whole room joined in the sport and coppers
rained into the player&rsquo;s hat. When the merrymaking
was over the musician ordered a meal so
little in keeping with his appearance that the landlady
gazed at him in astonishment, convinced that
he was a suspicious character who would probably
attempt to leave without paying for his food, and
determined to keep a watchful eye on him. As
soon as he had eaten he began to play again, and the
fun was at its height when a corporal entered and,
recognizing the august guest, saluted him respectfully.
It always annoyed the Duke to have his
incognito betrayed, and flinging a gold piece on the
table he hastily departed, to the great relief of the
embarrassed assemblage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Political Disturbances in Bavaria</span></h2>
<p>This idyllic life at Possenhofen was interrupted
for a time, however, by the political agitations
in Munich. All over Europe the
spirit of revolution was stirring, a spirit that was
soon to find expression in a general outbreak. Nowhere
did the royal power seem more secure than in
Bavaria. No monarch was more beloved than Ludwig
the First, no people so universally loyal to the
crown as his good-natured, easy-going subjects.
Nevertheless the popular upheaval was here, too,
bearing fruit, and a demand for more share in the
government, with a freer constitution, was becoming
general, although the immediate cause of the outbreak
in Munich and the King&rsquo;s subsequent abdication
had seemingly little to do with politics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>About this time a very beautiful and fascinating
public dancer, called Lola Montez, made her appearance
there and created a great sensation. Her
origin was obscure and uncertain; but the best authorities
seem to make her the daughter of an Irish
officer and a beautiful Spanish woman of Moorish
descent. She was born in Ireland in 1820 and
at the age of seventeen married one Lieutenant
James, with whom she went to the West Indies. She
soon left her husband, however, and returned to
England, where she prepared herself to become a
dancer. While hardly a regular beauty, Lola
Montez seems to have possessed in the highest
degree what the French call <i>la beaut&eacute; du diable</i>.
She had wonderful black hair, fiery eyes that could
change in an instant to melting warmth, a perfect
figure, with hands and feet so small and beautifully
shaped that a duchess might have envied them.</p>
<p>Her first appearance in London met with no great
success&mdash;a marked contrast to the enthusiasm she
afterward excited everywhere she went. After a
season in Paris she obtained a permanent position
at the royal theatre in Dresden, where she created a
tremendous sensation and was shown great favor
by the court. From there she went to Berlin, Warsaw,
and St. Petersburg, making a succession of
conquests and also many enemies by her violent
temper and the frequent use she made of her riding-whip
or dagger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>On the tenth of October, 1846, she appeared for
the first time at the court theatre in Munich and
immediately became the subject of violent discussion,
some raving over her beauty, her adventures,
and her triumphs, others denouncing her manners and
behavior and creating prejudice against her by reports
which even went so far as to call her a political
spy. Instead of the traditional ballet skirts, Lola
presented herself on this occasion in a Spanish costume
of silk and lace, diamonds sparkling here and
there upon it, her wonderful blue eyes flashing as
she curtsied low before the King, who was seated
in the royal box. She danced several Spanish
dances and all sat spellbound as one charming pose
followed another, fascinated by her supple grace
of motion and the art with which she could suddenly
change from glowing passion to the roguish smiles
of an innocent young girl. As soon as she stopped
dancing, however, the charm was broken and hisses
were mingled with the applause.</p>
<p>It was Ludwig&rsquo;s custom to receive all foreign
artists in person, before they could appear at the
court theatre. At his interview with Lola Montez
the old man had been completely fascinated by her
beauty and lively conversation, and was soon desperately
in love with the clever dancer, who knew
so well how to amuse and entertain him. He was
constantly seen in her company and at all her evening
parties, an intimacy which was not long in
arousing the displeasure of his family and subjects
to the highest degree. Public feeling against the
hated dancer soon began to display itself, and in the
following Spring she retired with the King to W&uuml;rzburg,
where she behaved with the same boldness
and indiscretion as in the capital.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>One day she made a frightful scene because the
guard would not allow her dog to enter the park
where she wished to walk. The officer on duty was
hastily summoned and tried to make her understand
that the soldier was in the right, whereupon
she struck him across the face with her riding-whip.
Out of respect for the King, no one ventured to arrest
her, but the officers and citizens of W&uuml;rzburg were
so infuriated she was forced to leave the city secretly.</p>
<p>The leader of the old Catholic party, Joseph
G&ouml;rres, worked actively against her, and the press
was not slow to fan the flame. Libels and lampoons
were spread broadcast throughout the city, enraging
the dancer, who in revenge forced the King to gratify
all her wishes and drew him ever deeper into her
toils. To annoy her enemies, and at the same time
obtain entrance for herself into the highest circles,
she persuaded the King to make her a countess.
This he could not do, however, without the consent
of his ministers, who positively refused to agree to
such an act; furthermore they sent a memorandum
to the King urging that Lola be expelled from the
kingdom. Ludwig replied to this request by dismissing
not only the entire ministry, but many of
their adherents, among whom were several professors
in the university; and from this time on &ldquo;the Bavarian
Pompadour,&rdquo; as Lola Montez has been called,
became an important factor in politics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The university was now like the glowing crater of
a volcano whence issued all the pent-up hatred and
discontent, and on the ninth of February, 1848, came
the first great eruption. Lola, whose southern blood
craved excitement, attempted to show herself among
the riotous throngs, but was forced to take refuge
in a church, thoroughly frightened for once. The
King was furious when he heard of this, and as the
students had been at the bottom of the demonstration,
he ordered the university closed and all non-resident
students sent away from Munich. The
next day the whole body of students marched through
the Karlstrasse to the house of their distinguished
chaplain, Professor Thiersch, singing songs of farewell,
and greeted with cheers from every window
they passed. There was a close bond of sympathy
between the university and the citizens, who held a
meeting at once, protesting against the severity of
the King&rsquo;s order and petitioning him to open the
university again. Ludwig promised to take the
matter into consideration, and after a conference
with his ministers agreed to yield to the wishes of
the citizens, furthermore proclaiming that the
Countess Landsfeld, as Lola was now called, should
be requested to leave Munich. &ldquo;No one shall come
between me and my people,&rdquo; he declared. This
news was received with great rejoicing and the house
in which the hated favorite lived was surrounded
day and night by curious throngs, anxiously awaiting
her departure. At last, on the morning of the
eleventh of February, the doors were suddenly thrown
open by a squad of police, and before the crowd
outside realized what was happening, the coach containing
the Countess had started off at a furious
gallop on the road to Blutenburg. From there she
fled to Lindau and thence to England, subsequently
making her way to the United States and later to
Australia, where she died in 1861 at the age of forty,
after a varied and adventurous career.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The revolution of February, which had already
taken place in Paris, was followed by similar uprisings
throughout Europe, and added fuel to the fire
in Bavaria. The citizens of Munich again rose in
revolt, and the Government could no longer remain
deaf to their just demands for a more liberal constitution.
The King made some concessions which
partially appeased the loyal Bavarians, and the disturbance
seemed about to subside, when a report
that Lola Montez had returned to Munich caused
a fresh outbreak. Official notices were posted that
evening on every street corner, affirming that the
Countess Landsfeld had left Karlsruhe on the fourteenth
of March for Frankfort, and had been forbidden
ever to set foot again on Bavarian soil; but
the people laughed this to scorn. The placards
were torn down and the insurgents continued their
work of destruction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>On the eighteenth of March, Munich found itself
in a state of siege. Ten thousand troops were in
arms to put an end, if possible, to the uprising.
Many deputations waited on the King and on the
States Assembly, which had convened in the meantime,
while the greater part of the people who had
taken no part in the disturbance waited anxiously
for developments. But King Ludwig was unable
to crush the rebellion; neither was he able to reconcile
himself to a new system of government.
Two days later Munich was startled by an unexpected
event. A proclamation was issued by the
sovereign, announcing his abdication, after a reign
of twenty-three years, in favor of his eldest son, to
whom he left the task of carrying out the reforms
demanded by the people. Dumbfounded at this
unforeseen step, the Bavarians, loyal still to the
house of Wittelsbach, were much affected, and many
felt remorseful at having rebelled against their King,
who, in spite of his faults, had been a good sovereign
and done much for his country. After his abdication,
Ludwig spent the remainder of his life as a
private citizen, partly in Bavaria, partly in Italy
and the south of France, interesting himself still
in art and plans for the further improvement of
Munich. He soon regained all his old popularity,
and felt no regrets for the rank and honors he had
renounced. He died in February, 1868; but some
years before that event, an equestrian statue of
him was erected in Munich by the grateful people

<br /><span class="h2line2">The Wittelsbach Sisters</span></h2>
<p>These stirring events naturally had not been
without their influence on Duke Max and
his family, although the relations between
them and the new sovereigns were no less cordial
and intimate than they had been with the former
ones.</p>
<p>At the time when Duke Max bought Possenhofen
the Crown Prince had acquired the castle of Hohenschwangen
in that same region and set a force of
artists and architects at work to make it an ideal
home for his bride. Prince Maximilian had spent
the greater part of his youth in travel, and during
a visit to the court of Berlin had first seen his future
wife, then but four years of age. She was a daughter
of Prince Karl of Prussia, and when he again met the
Princess Marie as a lovely girl of sixteen, he fell in
love with her on the spot. In the Autumn of 1841
he made a formal offer for her hand, and the marriage
took place on the fifth of October, 1842.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Like the ducal family, the youthful pair spent
most of the year at Hohenschwangen, the two princes
hunting and riding together, while a close friendship
developed between the Crown Princess and the
Duke&rsquo;s young daughters, which was in no way interrupted
by her becoming Queen of Bavaria.</p>
<p>These daughters, the Wittelsbach sisters, were
tenderly attached to one another and there was a
strong family resemblance between them. Four had
inherited their parents&rsquo; good looks, and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, the
oldest, while not so beautiful as the rest, was clever
and clear-headed like her mother. Elizabeth and
Maria both had a share of the family eccentricity;
but of all the eight children, Maria was the only one
endowed with Duke Max&rsquo;s high spirits and cheerful,
sunny nature. She also possessed to a marked degree
the distinguished bearing and grace of movement
so characteristic of the whole race, while added
to the gentle sweetness of Elizabeth&rsquo;s face, whom she
much resembled, was an expression of strength and
firmness unusual in one so young.</p>
<p>The five sisters were brought up in the simplest
manner, without regard to etiquette, and often walked
about the streets of Munich without attendants of
any kind. The Duke was much away from home and
concerned himself little with his children&rsquo;s education,
except as to music, sport, and out-of-door exercise;
but Ludovica was constantly with her daughters,
and devoted her whole life to fitting them for the positions
she was ambitious they should occupy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Elizabeth was famous for her beauty and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne
for her cleverness, while Maria was endowed with
almost an equal share of both. She was warm-hearted,
sweet-tempered, and incapable of falsehood,
but very impulsive and unable to adapt herself
to people; and the Duchess&rsquo;s methods of education
did little to modify her independence of speech and
action. Like Elizabeth, she was a passionate lover
of nature and of animals; but she was bolder and
less sensitive than her sister and early developed a
love of danger and excitement. The happy days
of childhood soon passed, however, and one by one
the sisters left the home nest. In 1854 Elizabeth
became Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary,
to the bitter disappointment of H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, who had
been selected as bride of Francis Joseph. The
Emperor preferred her younger sister, however, and
in 1858 H&eacute;l&egrave;ne consoled herself with the enormously
wealthy Hereditary Prince of Thurn and Taxis, and
went to Regensburg to live. Ludwig, the eldest
son, had renounced his right of succession the preceding
year to marry an actress in Augsburg, making
Karl Theodore, then in his twentieth year, the future
head of the house. Although the court of Possenhofen
was seemingly of small importance, it enjoyed
universal respect, and the Catholic royal houses of
Europe were glad to ally themselves with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>In the Autumn of 1858 a messenger arrived from
the King of Naples desiring to know whether the
Duke and Duchess would consent to an alliance
between their daughter Maria, then eighteen years
old, and his eldest son. The two families were
scarcely acquainted personally, and the young
people had never seen each other, yet the Duke and
Duchess returned an unconditional acceptance of
the offer. To be sure, the Neapolitan Prince was
considered a good match, being a Bourbon on his
father&rsquo;s side and a member of the royal house of
Sardinia on his mother&rsquo;s, and the heir, moreover, to
an ancient and important kingdom in fair Italy.</p>
<p>On the twenty-second of December, King Ferdinand&rsquo;s
minister, Count Ludolff, arrived in Munich
with a formal proposal of marriage, and after receiving
the young princess&rsquo;s consent, presented her on
a velvet cushion a portrait of her future husband, a
rather pleasant-looking young man in the uniform
of a hussar. Two weeks later the marriage took
place by proxy, as was the custom of the time. On
the evening of the eighth of January, 1859, Maria
Sophia Amalia, Duchess in Bavaria, was solemnly
united in wedlock to Francis Maria Leopold, Duke
of Calabria and Crown Prince of the Two Sicilies,
in the court chapel at Munich. All the members of
the royal house were present with the entire diplomatic
corps and many nobles and high officials of
the State. King Maximilian and Queen Marie led
the bride to the altar, where the bridegroom&rsquo;s brother,
Prince Leopold (the present Regent of Bavaria),
represented him in his absence. Following this ceremony
the King and Queen held a reception, during
which crowds gathered outside the palace windows,
eager for a glimpse of the little bride who had gone
about among them all her life so gayly and familiarly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>On the thirteenth of January, Maria left her
parents&rsquo; home with many tears and embraces for
the dear ones she was leaving behind. She had
never seen her husband nor any member of his
family. Both the land and people that were to be
hers in future were strange to her&mdash;an uncertain
fate, indeed, to look forward to! But she was
young and light-hearted, full of hope and courage,
and well equipped by nature for the trials that
awaited her. Her brother Ludwig, with several
Bavarian ladies and gentlemen, accompanied her on
the journey, besides a Neapolitan court lady, Nina
Rizzo, sent by the Queen of Naples to instruct her
in her new duties. At Vienna a stay of several days
was made, owing to news of King Ferdinand&rsquo;s illness;
but on the thirtieth of January the party resumed
its way with the addition of the Empress Elizabeth,
and on the following day reached Trieste, where they
were met by the Duke of Serracapriola, sent by the
King to welcome the future Queen of Naples. This
pompous personage discharged his errand with such
ceremonious solemnity that the simple, unaffected
Bavarian princess knew not whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>On the first of February, at half-past one, the ceremony
of delivering the bride into the hands of the
Neapolitan envoy took place in the Governor&rsquo;s
palace. Across the centre of the great salon a silken
cord had been stretched, representing the boundary
line between Bavaria and Naples. Beside this were
placed a table, covered with red velvet, and two
gilded arm-chairs. The room had folding doors at
either end, one of which was decorated with the
colors of Naples and guarded by Neapolitan marines,
while at the other, similarly adorned with Bavarian
arms and banners, stood a band of the royal Bavarian
retainers. The Neapolitan envoy, with two ladies of
high rank who had come to act as escort to the Princess,
were stationed on their side of the boundary
line with the Admiral and officers of the ship that
was to carry Maria Sophia and her suite to Naples,
while the Duchess and her Bavarian escort entered
through the other door and took their places. The
two envoys then advanced from their respective
positions to the silken cord, where they exchanged
documents concerning the marriage. The Count
von Rechburg addressed a few words of farewell
to the youthful bride, who rose and extended her
hand for her German attendants to kiss, after which
the Count led her to the middle of the room and gave
her into the hands of the Duke of Serracapriola, who
humbly begged her to seat herself in the Neapolitan
arm-chair while he delivered a short address of
congratulation and welcome. This almost medi&aelig;val
ceremony concluded, Maria left the salon through
the door draped in Neapolitan colors and went
directly on board the <i>Fulminante</i>, in the cabin of
which the Empress Elizabeth and Prince Ludwig
took an affecting farewell of their young sister. The
greater part of her suite embarked on another vessel,
the <i>Tancredo</i>, and an hour later both ships were
steaming out of the harbor of Trieste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Neapolitan Royal Family</span></h2>
<p>King Ferdinand the Second, the
reigning Prince of Naples at this time, came
of bad stock. The reign of his grandfather,
Ferdinand the First of Naples and Fourth of the
Two Sicilies, of whom King Frederick of Prussia
once aptly remarked that he was more fit for a
prison cell than a throne, had been one long scandal,
and his son, Francis the First, followed faithfully in
his father&rsquo;s footsteps during his short reign (1825-1830).
Ferdinand the Second had naturally a good
mind, and at the time of his accession to the throne
had roused great hopes by the military and financial
reforms he introduced and by his wise plans for
developing the resources of his impoverished kingdom.
This did not last long, however, for he soon
began to display the same despotic tendencies that
had made his father and grandfather so abhorred by
the people, and the older he grew the more marked
these became.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>The general movement toward liberty that shook
Europe in the nineteenth century had not been
without its effect, both in Naples and Sicily, as may
easily be supposed, considering the harsh rule which
the fiery southerners had been forced to endure so
long. Ferdinand had succeeded in crushing one
violent outbreak in 1848; but beneath the ashes the
fire still smouldered, and the inward ferment was
constantly increased by the extreme measures to
which &ldquo;Bomba,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
as the King was popularly called,
resorted, to maintain and strengthen his position.
He ruled with a despotism and intolerance that
suggested the worst days of the Inquisition. The
prisons were full of political &ldquo;criminals,&rdquo; whose only
crime was the holding of liberal views, or the suspicion
of doing so, and these victims were treated with
such revolting cruelty as to rouse the horror of the
civilized world. In spite of these things, however,
Bomba was not without some good qualities. In
private life he was both just and temperate, simple
in his habits, a good husband and father. He was
twice married. His first wife, to whom he was united
two years after his accession to the throne, was the
Princess Maria Christina of Sardinia&mdash;Italy&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Queen Dagmar&rdquo;&mdash;an angel of goodness and piety.
The people called her Saint Christina even during
her lifetime, and she was afterward canonized by
the Church of Rome. Such a woman could not but
exert a beneficial influence over her royal husband;
but it was unfortunately of short duration, for she
died in 1836, four years after her marriage, leaving
a son two weeks old, the Crown Prince Francis
Maria Leopold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Ferdinand had no intention of remaining long a
widower. He first wished to marry a daughter of
King Louis Philippe of France, but Austria persuaded
England to join in defeating this plan, which
would have resulted in too powerful a union of the
reigning Bourbon families. He then applied for
the hand of an Austrian princess, and in 1837 was
married to Maria Theresa, daughter of the Archduke
Karl, who presented him with five sons and
four daughters. In spite of her proud name and
lofty lineage, the new Queen was a very ordinary
person, though not without some homely virtues.
Her horizon was bounded by her family and her
household, in the duties of which she took an active
part, even mending her children&rsquo;s clothes with her
own hands, it is said; and she seems to have been
utterly lacking in the realization that a queen should
have other and wider duties than those of a housekeeper.
In simplicity of tastes she much resembled
her husband, who was most frugal in his mode of
living; but she sometimes went so far that even he
was annoyed, and one day at dinner he remonstrated
with her, saying: &ldquo;Come, come, Ther! [a nickname
he had for her] you will soon be making us wait
on ourselves at table!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The simplest fare was served in the royal
household. Macaroni was one of the principal
articles of diet, and a favorite dish of the King&rsquo;s
was raw onions, which he peeled with his fingers,
declaring that contact with a knife gave them
an unpleasant flavor. The Queen, however, never
liked Neapolitan cooking and always had some substantial
German dishes prepared for herself. She
could not speak Italian correctly, but learned only
the Neapolitan dialect, which she pronounced in a
most dreadful way, with her broad German accent.
In short, Ferdinand&rsquo;s second wife was as unpopular
as his first had been popular. She made no effort
to win the love of the people and her homely, plebeian
ways were little to the taste of the gay Neapolitans,
who adored glitter and display of any sort. The
King&rsquo;s favorite recreation was driving. He went
out every afternoon, taking some of his family and
usually holding the reins himself. The royal equipage
was always accompanied by a mounted escort,
while horsemen were stationed along the route the
King was to take, to detain all chance travellers
until he had passed by, not as a mark of respect, but
as a measure of precaution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Exemplary as this royal pair may have been from
the standpoint of a private citizen, as far as the
education of their children was concerned they were
certainly not successful. The teachers they chose
were almost exclusively bigoted Jesuits. Ferdinand
wished his sons to be taught Latin, French,
civil and administrative law, but they received no
military training of any kind. Even sports and
physical exercises were excluded from their plan of
education, nor were they permitted to travel or
acquire any knowledge of foreign lands or peoples.
Ferdinand&rsquo;s own education had been most imperfect.
He read little or nothing himself and wrote
his orders, even those pertaining to important affairs
of state, on any scrap of paper that came to hand,
sometimes even in the Neapolitan dialect. He regarded
all writers and literary men with contempt
as an inferior and objectionable race of beings&mdash;a
curious mixture of pride and prejudice which he
also displayed toward people of other nations. He
called the English, fishmongers, the French, barbers,
the Russians, tallow-eaters, etc. Austrians were the
only foreigners of whom he ever spoke with any
respect, and that was on his wife&rsquo;s account. In his
younger days he had possessed a fair share of the
Neapolitan humor, but it soon degenerated into
bitterness and sarcasm.</p>
<p>The following anecdote of him is characteristic.
Some public festival was being held in the square
in front of the palace and the King was standing on
a balcony with the Crown Prince, then still a child.
Gazing down on the crowds below and thinking
perhaps of the high position to which he would
one day be called, the boy turned suddenly to his
father with the question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could a King do with all these people?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;He could kill them all!&rdquo; replied Ferdinand, then
added solemnly, bowing low and crossing himself,
&ldquo;He could, my son, but he would not, out of respect
for the holy religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Ferdinand the Second&rsquo;s system of police and
priestly rule did not fail to bear fruit in the shape
of numerous uprisings and attempted assassinations
that terrorized the last years of his reign. He knew
himself to be an object of universal hatred and
that hundreds were plotting against his life, and
grew more nervous and uneasy every day. Added
to these mental anxieties he had acute physical
sufferings. The unfortunate prince could find no
rest, day or night. At the age of forty-five his hair
had turned completely white and he looked like an
old man.</p>
<p>His natural tendency toward bigotry increased
with illness and worry and he became as superstitious
as the most orthodox prince of the Middle
Ages. Before mounting a horse he always crossed
himself, and he never met a priest or monk on one of
his drives without stopping the carriage while he
alighted and knelt upon the ground until the holy
man had passed. He went frequently to confession
and had daily masses read for himself in all the
churches. Every night he prayed, rosary in hand,
with his wife and children, and before retiring would
kiss each of the holy images with which the walls
of his bedchamber were adorned. But even these
pious observances failed to bring relief. Conscience
tortured him, and he sought sleep in vain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The betrothal of his eldest son and heir to the
Bavarian Princess brought a gleam of light into the
darkness. The house of Wittelsbach, besides its
high rank and antiquity, was strongly orthodox in
its Catholicism, a most important item in Ferdinand&rsquo;s
eyes; and the alliance was a strong one
politically, for by it his son would become the
brother-in-law of the Emperor of Austria, and
closely connected also with several others of the
reigning houses of Europe. In spite of his state of
health, the King had determined to be present at
the second and real wedding of Francis and Maria,
and succeeded, indeed, in reaching Bari, where the
ceremony was to take place; but the fatigue and
hardships of a Winter journey over the Apennines
were too much for his strength, and he arrived at
Bari so ill and exhausted that there was no possibility
of his being able to assist in the festivities.</p>
<p>The King ill unto death, the country on the verge
of revolution, the royal house and kingdom threatened
by enemies at home and abroad&mdash;a sorry state
of affairs to greet the fair young Bavarian Princess,
entering for the first time the land of which she was
soon to become the sovereign!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Maria Sophia&rsquo;s Arrival</span></h2>
<p>It was on a beautiful Spring morning, the third of
February, 1859, that the Crown Princess approached
her new home. All the roads leading
to Bari were filled with curious sightseers, eager for
a glimpse of the bride. All tongues were busy with
praises of her beauty and goodness. Her name was
on every lip; but instead of being called the Princess
of Bavaria or Duchess of Calabria, she was and still
is familiarly spoken of in Italy as Maria Sophia, to
distinguish her from many of her predecessors on
the throne who had borne the name of Maria. The
whole royal family had journeyed to Bari to welcome
her and were lodged on the first floor of the
Intendant&rsquo;s palace, where apartments had also been
prepared for the Duchess of Calabria and her suite;
but in spite of the joyous air of expectancy that pervaded
the town, a dark cloud hung over the palace
itself, owing to the condition of the King, who was
confined to his bed and suffering greatly. He had
looked forward with the deepest pleasure and interest
to his son&rsquo;s marriage, and it was a bitter disappointment
to him not to be present at the wedding
ceremonies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the thunder of
cannon proclaimed the approach of the <i>Fulminante</i>
and the <i>Tancredo</i>. The troops lined up, the mayor
of Bari and other dignitaries took their places in a
pavilion which had been erected in the middle of
the landing stage for the bride&rsquo;s reception, while
ten state equipages, escorted by a mounted guard,
issued from the palace and drove down to the
pavilion, where the Queen, with her stepson, the
Duke of Calabria, and her little daughters, alighted
and boarded a steam launch to go out to meet the
Duchess.</p>
<p>On the <i>Fulminante</i>, meanwhile, all was stir and
excitement. The bride, as she stood on deck dressed
in a handsome travelling costume, looked more than
ever like her sister Elizabeth. She had the same
wonderful dark blue eyes and rich brown hair; and
although not so tall as the Empress, her figure was
quite as beautifully formed. On this occasion her
usual expression of childish innocence and gayety
had given place to one of serious expectancy, and
she was very pale, a result partly owing to fatigue,
partly to emotions natural to the situation. During
the journey she had plied Nina Rizzo and her
new chamberlain with questions about her future
husband; how he looked, how he behaved toward
his parents, his brothers, and his subjects; and she
had never tired of hearing tales of his childhood.
To her naive inquiry as to whether Francis was
really as disagreeable as he was said to be in Bavaria,
both had done their best to reassure the Princess by
expatiating on his good qualities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>It had stormed all night, but the sea now lay calm
and smiling as if in welcome, and it seemed to Maria
that she had never seen such a wonderful blue before.
As they drew near the beautiful harbor with the
town of Bari beyond, bathed in Italian sunshine,
she was so absorbed in the enchanting scene that at
first she did not notice the approaching launch.
Suddenly she caught sight of Francis standing up
in the craft in his gay hussar uniform, and her face
lit up with a joyous smile. She recognized him at
once from his portrait and found him more agreeable-looking
than she had expected. Advancing to the
side of the vessel to meet him as he came aboard, she
held out her hand with charming impulsiveness and
said, &ldquo;Bonjour, Fran&ccedil;ois!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bonjour, Marie!&rdquo; replied the Prince, shyly taking
both her hands in his and kissing her on the forehead.
The Queen then embraced the young girl and
presented her to the princesses, Maria inquiring
solicitously for the King and expressing her regret
at his absence. She then asked with great interest
about the coast, the town they were approaching,
the vessels in the harbor, and all the new sights and
scenes about her. The young bridegroom, meanwhile,
stood silent and embarrassed beside his stepmother,
so overcome with the emotion of meeting
his bride and finding her even more fascinating than
he had dared to imagine, that he was more shy
and awkward than usual and could only stammer a
few disjointed words in answer to her questions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>At the landing they were met by the assembled
officials and escorted to the pavilion, where the royal
party entered their coaches and drove back to the
palace. Maria&rsquo;s beauty and girlish charm won
instant favor. A storm of cheers greeted her
entrance into the new land; and even after she had
disappeared within the palace, the enthusiastic
Italians continued to shout till she was obliged to
come out and show herself once more on a balcony.
The Crown Princess had scarcely time, however, to
acknowledge the people&rsquo;s homage, before she was
summoned to the King&rsquo;s bedside. She found him
sitting up to greet her, his face deeply lined with
suffering. With all a father&rsquo;s tenderness, Ferdinand
embraced his new daughter-in-law, shedding tears
at this sorrowful meeting, so different from what he
had hoped for, while Maria also wept and returned
the embrace warmly. It was the first time in this
foreign land that she had been welcomed with anything
like the affection to which she had been accustomed
at home, and she felt drawn at once to her
dying father-in-law, who had taken her into his heart
at their very first meeting, realizing with pity how
thickly strewn with thorns must be the path in life
of this fair young creature who seemed made only
for joy and happiness. Maria had little time to
dwell on this scene, however, for the Queen led her
away almost immediately to her chamber, where
Nina Rizzo exchanged her travelling suit for the
white satin bridal robe, and placed on her luxuriant
hair&mdash;a characteristic of all the Wittelsbach sisters&mdash;a
wreath of orange blossoms with a magnificent
lace veil which she had brought with her from home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>An altar had been erected in the banqueting hall,
the walls of which were lined with pictures of the
Madonna. Before the altar a throne with arm-chairs
was placed for the princes and princesses. The
bishops and distinguished guests had taken their
places and the ceremony was about to begin, when an
incident occurred that made it hard for those present
to preserve their gravity. The Queen&rsquo;s second son,
Alphonso, Count of Caserta, who though eighteen
years old was as wild and ungovernable as a schoolboy,
had succeeded in fastening a long paper train
to the uniform of one of the highest court officials,
whose solemn air of unconsciousness only added to
the humor of the situation. One of the court gentlemen,
however, quietly managed to remove the ridiculous
appendage, the victim remaining in blissful
ignorance of the trick that had been played upon
him.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p01.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="856" />
<p class="caption"><i>MARIA SOPHIA<br />at the time of the accession</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The young couple entered and took their places
before the altar, where the bishop concluded the
ceremony with a solemn address in Italian, invoking
the blessing of God upon them. At the close of the
Te Deum an orchestra struck up the National Hymn
and a salvo of artillery announced to the waiting
crowds without that the marriage was completed,
while the bridal pair went at once to the King&rsquo;s
chamber to receive his paternal blessing. That
evening the whole town was brilliantly illuminated,
and the square before the palace was filled with
cheering throngs far into the night; but in spite of
these demonstrations there was much secret uneasiness
as to the King&rsquo;s condition. The excitement of
the wedding had had a bad effect on Ferdinand;
though he did all in his power to conceal his sufferings,
and the royal family seemed quite unaware of
the alarming nature of his illness.</p>
<p>When the Count of Caserta&rsquo;s mischievous prank
reached the ears of the King, he sent for that youth
and administered a sharp rebuke, declaring such a
performance could only have been expected of a
street urchin. Three days&rsquo; confinement to his room
was to be his punishment, but at the Queen&rsquo;s intercession
the sentence was somewhat lightened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Strange Honeymoon</span></h2>
<p>The early months of the married life of Francis
and Maria Sophia were similar in many
ways to those of Marie Antoinette and Louis
the Sixteenth of France. Francis, like Louis, was
awkward, timid, and doubtful of himself. Although
brought up in the land of art and beauty, he had
no taste for such things. Like the King of France,
he was honest, just, and deeply religious, but weak
and irresolute, and conspicuously lacking in those
qualities naturally looked for in princes of royal
lineage.</p>
<p>Equally marked were the points of resemblance
between Marie Antoinette and Maria Sophia. Both
were gay, childish, and impulsive, with remarkable
personal courage and a frankness that was as attractive
as it was dangerous; both were too beautiful
not to excite envy, and too full of high spirits not to
cause offence. The Wittelsbach Princess, however,
had qualities the Dauphiness lacked&mdash;perfect honesty
and the robust health and splendid vitality
brought from her Bavarian Alps. She was a finished
horsewoman, a good shot, a tireless walker, and
devoted to out-of-door recreations of all sorts. Her
husband, on the other hand, was grave, silent, and
melancholy. Sports had no attraction for him. He
never hunted, and in spite of his hussar uniform
the Neapolitans declare that he was never known
to mount a horse. One point, however, they shared
in common&mdash;indifference to luxury and love of
simplicity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>At the time of her marriage the Crown Princess
could scarcely speak a word of Italian. Francis&rsquo;s
knowledge of French was very limited, and of German
he was entirely ignorant, so that unrestrained
communication between the young couple was difficult
at first. The education of the Duke of Calabria
had done little to prepare him for the lofty
position that awaited him. His stepmother, who
completely spoiled her own children, neglected him
shamefully in some ways and was unnecessarily
harsh in others. Overshadowed by his cleverer
stepbrothers, who despised him, and conscious of
his own mental and physical deficiencies, the poor
boy had become morbidly shy and reserved. Yet
he had many good qualities. He never forgot the
smallest service shown him, and was invariably kind
and courteous even to the humblest. Many tales
are told of his sympathy with the poor and suffering,
and even as a child he would part with his dearest
treasure to help any one in distress. But his appearance
was so unprepossessing as to be almost unpleasant;
and the consciousness of this made him
appear at his worst with his wife, whose beauty and
vivacity so enthralled him that he became dumb at
her approach and would often hide behind the door
when she entered the room, to avoid speaking to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The Neapolitan court was a contrast in more ways
than one to the home Maria Sophia had left, and for
which she yearned so longingly. Barely eighteen
years old, overflowing with health and spirits, she
found herself surrounded by an atmosphere of false
humility, deceit, and religious hypocrisy; and although
her natural light-heartedness helped her
through many troubles and disappointments in the
new life, yet she could never forget that she was a
stranger in a strange land, alone and almost friendless.
Fond as her father-in-law was of her, he was
too ill to be able to do anything toward making her
life pleasant, and the little princesses, while outwardly
civil, were stiff and unsympathetic. With
her brothers-in-law she was on a somewhat better
footing, for they were charmed with the zest with
which she entered into their sports; but the Queen
from the very first had treated her with the most
marked unfriendliness, correcting her constantly,
as if she had been a schoolgirl, and regarding her
most innocent diversions with suspicion. She even
refused to allow her to ride, as she had been used to
do at home; and the young Duchess sorely missed
her favorite occupation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Maria Theresa was a woman of strong will and
had been accustomed to obedience from her family
as well as her subjects. She had selected her most
trusted lady-in-waiting to attend her stepson&rsquo;s
wife, hoping that Nina Rizzo, who was devoted to
her mistress, would teach the Crown Princess to
bow to her will as every one else did. But in this
she was mistaken, for though Maria Sophia liked
Nina, she remained deaf to all her exhortations on
the subject, firmly determined to preserve her independence
at all costs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the King grew steadily worse, and the
cloud over the palace darkened. The young princes
tried to relieve the gloom and pass away the time by
walks about the town, running races in the palace
courtyard, and playing tricks on the gentlemen of
the court, pastimes in which they were frequently
joined by Maria Sophia. One day she went down
to the shore and, with the help of an old boatman,
succeeded in catching a whole basketful of fish which
she bore home in triumph and had cooked for the
royal table. Another time she promised her brothers-in-law
to make them some Bavarian pancakes. A
portable grate was secured and placed over a charcoal
fire, and the Princess set to work. But no frying-pan
or ladle was to be had. At this moment the
mayor of Bari made his appearance, in gold-laced
coat and knee breeches, to pay his respects at court.
Maria Sophia was no longer in a quandary. In her
own lively way she begged the official to go down
into the market-place and get her the needed utensils.
The obliging mayor hastened to do her bidding, and
soon returned with the desired articles; but the
result of the Princess&rsquo;s culinary labors was most
unsatisfactory after all, for the pancakes proved
uneatable. Large holes were burned in the tablecloth
and napkins, and amid shouts of laughter
Maria Sophia abandoned any further attempts to
shine as a cook in Italy. The mayor carried the
frying-pan and ladle home with him as souvenirs
of the merry scene, and they are still preserved as
relics in his family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Amid the general sadness that prevailed, however,
these lively outbreaks became less and less frequent,
and the young Duchess hailed with joy the
news that the court was to move to Caserta. Nina
Rizzo had often told her of the beauties of that
place, and she eagerly looked forward to their departure
as an hour of deliverance. The journey was
long deferred, however, as the King&rsquo;s sufferings were
so acute he would not allow himself to be moved.
A monk at length succeeded in persuading the sick
man to consent, and he was carried on a mattress
to a steam frigate which was to convey him from
Bari to Portici in order to avoid any stop at Naples.
From Portici to Caserta the five hours&rsquo; journey caused
the unfortunate sovereign such torture that the
Archbishop of Naples ordered continuous prayers
to be offered for him in all the churches. Once
amid these new surroundings&mdash;the lofty halls and
salons of the palace, the enchanting park and gardens&mdash;Maria
Sophia&rsquo;s spirits rose, and she felt almost
happy again. But it was not for long. Between the
Queen&rsquo;s animosity and her husband&rsquo;s weakness, she
soon relapsed into her old loneliness and helplessness.
Almost her only diversion now was her family
of parrots. She had ten, and her laughter over the
ludicrous results of their attempts to speak German
was the sole evidence that her natural gayety was
not entirely suppressed and crushed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Meanwhile the Queen&rsquo;s supposed treasonable designs
were freely discussed throughout the kingdom.
It was said that on the King&rsquo;s death she intended
to seize the double crown for her own son, and that
many of the police officials were ready to support
her plans; also that the Crown Prince was forcibly
excluded from his father&rsquo;s sick-room. There was
no truth in this latter report, however; for although
Francis had indeed been carefully kept from taking
any part in affairs of state hitherto, now at the
eleventh hour, Ferdinand insisted upon having his
son with him constantly, and giving him instructions
for future guidance; these the Crown Prince
copied on a sheet of paper and used frequently to
consult after he became King. On the tenth of
April Ferdinand made his last will and testament,
leaving equal portions of his property to each of his
children, with a large share to his wife, and a twelfth
part to be divided among religious institutions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>In spite of the statements already published in
regard to the amount and distribution of his estate,
Ferdinand was popularly believed to own enormous
sums in private, mainly derived from confiscation
of the property of political criminals. His fortune
was said to amount to three hundred million ducats.
As a matter of fact, however, the King&rsquo;s actual
property was scarcely more than seven million
ducats, although he owned a great number of jewels
and other valuables.</p>
<p>On the twelfth of April Ferdinand received the
last sacrament; but he lived on for more than a
month. The superstitious Neapolitans expected his
death to occur on the fifteenth of May, the anniversary
of the riots there in 1848, of which the King had
taken advantage for his shameful persecution of
his subjects; but it was not till the twenty-second of
May that his sufferings were finally ended. A frightful
storm broke out during the hour of his death and
this was looked upon by many as a bad omen for
the new reign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Accession of Francis II and Maria Sophia</span></h2>
<p>Aside from the comparatively small circle at
Bari, few of her subjects had ever seen the
new Queen, while Francis himself was
almost as little known to the people. A few days
after their accession, the youthful sovereigns held a
levee at the royal palace in Naples. The King in
his hussar uniform, and the Queen in her crown and
ermine robes, stood under a canopy in the centre of
the great hall, while all the high officials, nobles, and
dignitaries of the court and kingdom stepped forward
to kiss the hands of Their Majesties. As the
gorgeously attired procession wound its way past
the throne, the sudden appearance of a band of poets
striding along in their long black cloaks and broad-brimmed
hats formed such a startling contrast to the
rest of the glittering throng that Maria Sophia burst
into an irrepressible peal of laughter which soon
spread to all about her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Freed at last from the dreadful oppression that
had weighed her down as Crown Princess, she quickly
recovered her exuberance of spirits, which found
expression in various ways. The relations between
her and her husband also became much more free
and natural after their accession to the throne.
Francis had begun, soon after the wedding, to be in
love with his wife, although he did not show it. The
long system of repression to which he had become
accustomed had inflicted permanent injuries on his
sensitive nature; but Maria Sophia&rsquo;s personal charm
was so great and her gayety so spontaneous that it
was impossible for him to escape her fascination.
Under his awkward manner, however, she did not
perceive his dawning love for her, while he felt
strange in the world of lovers and was unable to
express his feelings, except by the eagerness with
which he fulfilled her slightest wish. Nor did Maria
Sophia hesitate to use her power. Once her own
mistress, she quickly cast off the yoke laid upon her
by the Queen at Bari and Caserta, and gave unmistakable
proof that she, too, had a strong will.</p>
<p>At table she would beg permission to have her
favorite dog, Lyonne, in the room. The King
always consented; and the huge Newfoundland with
her four pups would come tearing in and enjoy themselves
during the rest of the meal, leaping madly
about the table, and sometimes even upon it, to
the indignation of the court and their mistress&rsquo;s intense
delight. Photography had recently come into
fashion, and she had herself taken in every possible
position and costume, greatly to the disgust of her
mother-in-law, who objected strongly to her continual
changes of costume and her frequent riding
excursions. But the time was past when Maria
Sophia allowed herself to be dictated to. Like a
young Amazon she dashed about the streets of
Naples, exciting universal admiration and amazement
at her daring horsemanship.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">

<p class="caption"><i>FRANCIS SECOND<br />King of Naples</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>As Crown Prince, Francis the Second had not been
unpopular with the people. His mother had been
almost worshipped; and the Neapolitans pitied the
sickly boy whose life, even, so it was said, had been
attempted by his stepmother. But he was utterly
lacking in the qualities necessary for a sovereign.
It needed a clear head and a firm hand to guide the
ship of state safely through those stormy seas. His
judgment was sound enough; but he was good-natured
to the point of weakness, and superstitious to an
almost fanatical degree. He never let a day pass
without hearing mass, and went regularly to confession.
One of his favorite occupations was to hold
long religious conversations with Father Borelli and
other priests who happened to be at court. He
talked much of his dead mother, before whose portrait
he would kneel for hours in prayer, and he
would frequently clasp his head in his hands as if in
distress, crying, &ldquo;Ah, how heavy this crown is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, soon after his accession, while holding a
conference with his minister of finance, Raymondo del
Liguoro, the table at which they sat moved slightly,
and the minister turned to see what had caused it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was I who shook the table,&rdquo; said the King.
&ldquo;I had a sudden fit of trembling. That is a bad
sign. It means that I shall die soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Liguoro adjured His Majesty to banish such
thoughts, as his life was not his own, but belonged
to the people over whom he ruled. &ldquo;I do not value
either my life or my kingdom very highly,&rdquo; replied
Francis. &ldquo;I always think of what is written, &lsquo;The
Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The dowager Queen was a truly proverbial stepmother.
She had never been able to reconcile herself
to having her stepson inherit the united kingdoms
while her own sons had nothing; even during her
husband&rsquo;s lifetime she had attempted to secure the
succession of her eldest boy to the throne of Sicily.
But King Ferdinand would not listen to this. On
his death-bed he had extracted a solemn oath from
each member of his family to support the rightful
heir, and after his death the widowed Queen had
flung herself at her stepson&rsquo;s feet and promised him
her allegiance. That she broke this vow has never
been historically verified, the only proofs having
been generously destroyed by King Francis himself.
It happened in this way. Minister Filangieri had
long suspected Maria Theresa of being at the head
of a conspiracy to depose the young sovereign and
place her son, the Count of Trani, on the throne, and
at last succeeded in obtaining certain proof of this.
He carried the documents at once to the King; but
Francis refused to look at them. Without a glance
he flung them into the fire, saying, &ldquo;She was my
father&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Maria Theresa afterward indignantly denied this,
declaring the whole affair a plot to sow discord between
her and the King; but, be that as it may, there
is no doubt that she was greatly to blame for Francis&rsquo;s
lack of education and training in early youth and
childhood. She had brought him up as if he had
been a girl, destined to live in retirement, rather
than as a man who had a lofty mission to fulfil, emphasizing
his natural awkwardness and timidity, and
choosing tutors totally unfitted to prepare his mind
for the demands of the times and his future position.
His whole nature had been cowed and stunted in
order that he might be kept subservient to her will.</p>
<p>She had also attempted these tactics with Maria
Sophia, but with less success. The Bavarian Princess
was far too self-reliant to submit to any such
yoke. She was quite as strong-willed as her mother-in-law,
besides being far wiser and cleverer. She
also had her own political views, which were directly
opposed to those of the dowager Queen. The latter
was full of the old ideas of absolutism and had no
sympathy with the new spirit of liberty, while Maria
Sophia openly proclaimed her liberal opinions and
urged the King to grant the country more freedom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>History shows that many women have filled the
highest and most important positions with credit
and honor. England has her Elizabeth, Russia her
Catherine, Austria and Hungary their Maria Theresa,
Scandinavia its Margareta. Maria Sophia of Naples
is yet another example of feminine ability and judgment
in political affairs. King Francis had no abler
counsellor than his own wife, and had he followed her
advice the issue of events might have been very different.
But he was blinded by prejudice, by family
tradition, by his education, and by court intrigues.
As a child he had witnessed the bloody riots in Naples
and been taught to regard such outbreaks as criminal
attacks on a divinely instituted form of government.
Even before his illness, Ferdinand had taken pains
to instill his own principles into his son, and almost
with his last breath had urged him never to allow
himself to be carried away by the stream of liberalism
that threatened to overflow Italy. Much as Francis
loved and admired his young wife, therefore, he
found it impossible to break away from the despotic
ideas in which he had been steeped from his infancy,
and not until it was too late did he realize the wisdom
of her advice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Garibaldi</span></h2>
<p>Meanwhile events were occurring in
northern Italy that were to exert a far-reaching
influence on the Kingdom of
Naples. The throne of Sardinia was occupied by a
bold and able sovereign, Victor Emanuel of Savoy,
who was fortunate enough to have as his counsellor
Cavour, one of the foremost statesmen of the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>Together with Napoleon the Third, Victor Emanuel
had inflicted a series of defeats on the Austrians
early in 1859, breaking their rule in Lombardy, and
thereby giving a tremendous impetus to the spirit
of Italian unity. It was as if the whole country
had suddenly awakened to a realization of the fact
that the various States into which Italy had been
divided for centuries really belonged together;
and the idea of uniting them seized the popular
mind with irresistible force. It is interesting to
note that the national movement which occurred
some ten years later in Germany had many points
of resemblance to this. Both nations had only of
late aspired to greater political importance: both
were good fighters and governed by princes who knew
how to wield the sword themselves, as well as to
choose their generals and statesmen. In both cases
the right men appeared at the right moment&mdash;Von
Moltke and Bismarck in Germany, Garibaldi and
Cavour in Italy. Cavour had several times attempted
to bring about an alliance between Sardinia
and Naples during the reign of Ferdinand; but his
offers had been treated with scorn by that short-sighted
monarch. After his death and the brilliant
victory over the Austrians at Magenta, overtures
to this end were again made by Sardinia to the new
King of Naples.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>On the twenty-fourth of June, 1859, Victor Emanuel
sent Salmour, one of his ablest and most trusted
diplomats, to Naples. He reminded Francis of the
ties of blood that bound him to the house of Savoy,
and pointed out the fact that an alliance between
the two kingdoms would be security for the independence
of Italy. The plan had been warmly
supported by the press of northern Italy and its
popularity was testified to by the enthusiasm with
which Salmour&rsquo;s arrival was hailed in Naples. But,
on the other hand, it met with powerful opposition
at court, especially on the part of the dowager Queen,
who, as an Austrian archduchess, was bitter against
Sardinia for the defeats her native land had suffered
at its hands, and used all her influence to prejudice
the weak young King against the plan. As a result,
Salmour was obliged to return without accomplishing
his object and the diplomatic transactions were
never made public. But though Francis might reject
the offer of such an alliance, he could not prevent
the idea of a union between northern and southern
Italy meeting with popular favor; and it spread
with such lightning rapidity throughout the two
kingdoms that soon only a spark was needed to
kindle public enthusiasm into a blaze. In less than
a year from the time that Francis refused Victor
Emanuel&rsquo;s proposal, that spark appeared in the form
of Garibaldi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>On the sixth of May, 1860, Garibaldi embarked
at Genoa with a thousand volunteers, and on the
eleventh landed at Marsala, on the west coast of
Sicily. Brave and hardy as his followers were, it
was a hazardous undertaking to attempt, with such
a force, to attack an army of over one hundred
thousand regular troops; but Garibaldi knew his
adversary and hoped for assistance from the people.
On the fourteenth of May he assumed the dictatorship
of the island in the name of Victor Emanuel,
and the next day, with the aid of some hundred
revolutionists, defeated General Laudi&rsquo;s force of
three thousand men who were occupying the heights
of Calatafimi. When the Garibaldians lit their
watchfires that night on the field of victory, they
had good cause for rejoicing. The first battle had
been fought and won. The Neapolitan troops were
fleeing in confusion toward Alcamo. The people&rsquo;s
leader had shown that he could defeat a king&rsquo;s
army, and the Neapolitans had learned to fear the
tri-colored banner and the red shirt. While the
Neapolitan generals were vainly searching for Garibaldi
in the mountains, he was already pressing
on towards Palermo, the capital, meeting with strong
support from the people everywhere. After three
days of hard fighting before that city, it capitulated,
and was occupied by the revolutionists, although
two weeks elapsed before the dictator could follow
up his victory. At the end of that time he again
took the war-path and at Melazzo surprised the
columns of General Bosco, who was in command of
the finest and best disciplined troops in Sicily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>On the twenty-eighth of June the Neapolitans
were forced to evacuate Messina, and a few days
later the &ldquo;red shirts,&rdquo; whose force had now increased
to about twenty thousand men, camped in the streets
of that city, from Taormina to Capo del Faro. Sicily
was won. Garibaldi now turned his glances toward
the mainland, whose mountains towered threateningly
above him across the straits, and on the evening
of the twenty-first of August the banner of Italy
floated above the fortifications of Reggio, the strongest
post in Calabria. The defence of Reggio was the
last effort of the royalist army south of Naples. Defeated
and disheartened, they retreated northward,
leaving the fortified towns to vie with one another
in throwing open their gates to the conquerors. The
fleet, too, seemed paralyzed. It made no effort to
prevent the passage of Garibaldi&rsquo;s men from Sicily,
but proceeded northward to Naples without having
fired a gun. Europe was dumb with amazement
at the audacity of these champions of liberty. Garibaldi&rsquo;s
march from the southern extremity of Italy
to Naples appeared at that time, as it still does, like
a tale of the imagination. It seemed incredible
that the splendid army created by King Ferdinand
with the labors and sacrifices of thirty years could
go to pieces like a building in an earthquake. Of
course there were many reasons for this, but the
chief one was Garibaldi himself. No man could
have been better fitted for the leadership of such a
movement. Glowing with patriotism and love of
liberty, inspired with the idea of Italian unity, yet
at the same time a true democrat, friend of the
oppressed and foe to tyranny, disinterested, self-sacrificing,
bold, and daring, a knight without fear
and without reproach, he seemed created to be an
ideal popular hero. Wherever he appeared in his
red shirt and black felt hat he aroused the wildest
enthusiasm; and popular fancy soon invested him
with a halo of glory almost equal to that of
William Tell in Switzerland or Joan of Arc in
France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>By forced marches Garibaldi continued his triumphant
progress, giving the royal troops no time to
recover themselves. Twenty days after he had first
set foot on the shores of Naples, he was at Salerno,
only a few miles from the capital. Everywhere he
was hailed as a liberator, his army welcomed with
flowers and recruits where they had expected to
find only foes. Well might he have said with C&aelig;sar,
&ldquo;I came, I saw, I conquered!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>These events created the greatest consternation
at the court of Naples, and many royalists fled the
country in terror. The dowager Queen&rsquo;s father,
Archduke Charles of Austria, had advised King
Ferdinand many years before to fortify Gaeta and
Capua strongly, so as to have a safe retreat in case
of revolution; and mindful of her father&rsquo;s words,
Maria Theresa immediately betook herself to Gaeta
with all her children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>On the news of Garibaldi&rsquo;s landing, Francis had
consulted the Duke de Chambord as to the state of
affairs. &ldquo;With the enemy at the gates, there is no
time for concessions and reforms,&rdquo; the head of the
house of Bourbon replied. &ldquo;The King should mount
and lead his troops against this Garibaldi and his
followers!&rdquo; This answer was quite in accordance
with the young Queen&rsquo;s opinion. She had been
strongly in favor of the alliance with Victor Emanuel;
but now that the opportunity for that was past and
the enemy was advancing, it seemed to her there
could be no other course than to take up arms in
defence of the kingdom. Mirabeau declared that
Marie Antoinette was the only man about Louis
the Sixteenth, and those who were with Maria
Sophia at this time have said the same of her; for
she seemed to be the only one at court who did not
lose her head. She tried in every way to encourage
her husband and urge him to fight; but to her
despair Francis seemed incapable of arriving at any
decisive course of action. He wavered to and fro
like a reed in the wind, doubtful of himself and
suspicious of all about him; seeking for support
now here, now there, but unable to decide on anything
till it was too late, and the time for parleying
was past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Flight from Naples</span></h2>
<p>On the fourth of September news was received
that Garibaldi was nearing Naples with a
large army, the number of which was enormously
exaggerated, however. The King hastily
summoned a council in the middle of the night. The
only remedy for the situation now would have been
to attempt to block Garibaldi&rsquo;s approach by attacking
him at Salerno, which was connected with Naples
by rail; but General Bosco, who was in favor of this
course, was ill in bed, and his views were not shared
by the other commanders, who feared the revolutionists
might effect a landing nearer the city, thus
cutting off the troops from a retreat. They all
agreed that it was better to make Capua and Gaeta
the centre of operations against the enemy, and the
only dissenting voice was that of the aged General
Carrascosa, who declared to the King, &ldquo;If Your
Majesty leaves Naples now, you will never return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words made no impression, however. Francis
left it to the generals to decide; but they refused to
take the responsibility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>As a last resort, Maria Sophia pointed out to her
husband that it was his duty to prevent his capital
from being destroyed by a bombardment; and in
this appeal she was joined by Cardinal Riario Sforza,
who besought the King to save Naples from fire and
sword. He was thinking, no doubt, of the one hundred
and eighty churches within the city walls; but
his words had the desired effect, for Francis had
the deepest reverence for anything that concerned
religion. The next morning he summoned Sforza to
the palace and informed him that he had decided
to withdraw the army to a strong position between
Capua and Gaeta. At the same time he requested
his trusted counsellor, Spinelli, to assist him in drawing
up a farewell proclamation to the people; and
after this had been accomplished, he went out to
drive with the Queen in an open carriage, escorted
by two gentlemen of the court. It was their last
ride through the streets of Naples.</p>
<p>Francis, however, did not betray the slightest
anxiety over the important step he was about to
take; and as for the Queen, she was apparently in
her usual spirits, laughing and joking with the King
and her two cavaliers: yet how often in those weary
years of exile must their thoughts have reverted in
memory to that scene they now looked upon with
such indifference!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>At the end of the Strada di Chiaja, directly in
front of the court apothecary&rsquo;s shop, the royal
carriage was stopped by a long line of loaded wagons.
The apothecary had a sign over his door, bearing the
Bourbon lilies, and a man was now mounted on a
ladder busily engaged in removing it. The Duke
of San Donato, who happened to be passing, was
furious at the sight and expressed his anger in no
measured terms; but neither Francis nor Maria
Sophia showed the least displeasure. They only
looked at each other and laughed at the apothecary&rsquo;s
foresight. The following morning the King&rsquo;s proclamation
was displayed on every street corner in
Naples. It was calm and dignified in tone, and
expressed less resentment than resignation. At the
same time he issued a protest to all the foreign
powers against Garibaldi&rsquo;s invasion of his territory,
together with an assertion of his rights. It was no
small task to prepare for so sudden a flight, and
there was little sleep that night in the palace. Huge
vans were loaded and sent off secretly under military
guard, and their contents carried early the next
morning on board two steamships which lay at
anchor in the harbor; but in the hurry, only personal
belongings were taken, and all the treasures of the
palace, such as the vast quantities of gold and silver
plate that had been accumulated during the hundred
and twenty-six years of Bourbon rule in Naples, were
left behind and afterwards confiscated by Garibaldi
and turned over to the provisional Government. All
that Francis carried away with him, except for a
chest containing various relics and images of saints,
were a painting of St. Peter, a statue and marble
bust of Pope Pius the Ninth, a Titian portrait of
Alexander Farnese, and a Holy Family by Raphael.
Of these, the last was undoubtedly the most valuable;
but even this splendid work of art the
young sovereigns did not keep. The Spanish
ambassador, Bermudez de Castro, begged Francis
to give it to him, and the good-natured King consented.
De Castro afterward tried to sell it to the
Louvre galleries, but was not satisfied with the
price offered. He then sent it to the South
Kensington Museum in London, where by an
unskilful attempt at restoration it lost so much of
its beauty and value that no one would buy it.
In his will the ambassador returned it to the
exiled King; but neither Francis nor Maria Sophia
ever claimed it, and the painting still remains at
South Kensington.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>On the morning of the sixth of September, Francis
sent for the commander of the National Guard, and
after expressing his thanks for their loyal support,
repeated the comforting assurance that the troops
had received strict orders to protect the capital. He
had prepared a list of those of his court whom he
wished to accompany him to Gaeta; but when the
time came to leave, the royal master of the horse,
Count Micha&euml;lo Imperiale, was the only member of
the royal household present. The King was so
touched by his devotion that he presented him on
the spot with the Grand Cross of the Order of San
Fernando.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>About four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the ministers
repaired in a body to the palace to take leave of their
sovereign, whose hand they were to kiss for the last
time under his own roof. Francis tried hard to control
himself, speaking kindly to all, and tenderly
embracing his two most devoted friends, Torella
and Spinelli. But the number present was pitifully
small. Those who had received the most favor at
the hands of their sovereigns were as usual the first
to desert them. Nor were there any special manifestations
of regret and sympathy among the populace
at the departure of the King and Queen, which
was regarded merely as a measure for assuring the
safety of the city, while Garibaldi&rsquo;s approach was
anticipated with mingled hope and fear.</p>
<p>About half-past six Francis and Maria Sophia
left the palace on foot, he in uniform as usual, she
in an ordinary travelling dress and large straw hat
trimmed with flowers. Accompanied by several
ladies and gentlemen of the court, they walked
through the palace gardens and down the long
flight of steps that led to the arsenal, the Queen
leaning on her husband&rsquo;s arm, gay and cheerful as
ever in spite of the ominous cloud that shadowed
their departure. Below them lay the Gulf of Naples,
smooth and bright as silver; but in the distance the
bare, sombre peak of Vesuvius rose like a menace
amid the smiling beauty of nature. The firemen of
the ship in which the royal party was to embark
had had to be kept on board by force, and some
advised the King to place himself under the protection
of some foreign flag, or to escape from the city
secretly. Undecided, as usual, Francis knew neither
what he could do, nor what he ought to do; but the
captain of the vessel, who was thoroughly loyal,
finally persuaded him to go on board, urging that it
would be beneath the King&rsquo;s dignity to flee from his
capital like a criminal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Only one Italian vessel accompanied the King,
but with it were two Spanish warships carrying the
Austrian, Prussian, and Spanish ambassadors. The
journey was most depressing. It had been decided
upon so suddenly that no one thought of taking
such ordinary things as food or even the few necessaries
that would have made them comfortable. It
was a wonderfully beautiful night, and the Queen sat
on deck until ten o&rsquo;clock, when it grew cold. Worn
out with the fatigues and excitement of the last
twenty-four hours, she went into the little deck cabin
and lay down on a sofa. The King did not go to bed
at all. Except for a few words now and then with the
Captain, he spent the night silently pacing up and
down the deck, watching the shores of Naples gradually
fade from view, and thinking, who knows what?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>About two o&rsquo;clock he asked whether the Queen
had retired, and when told she was still asleep in
the little cabin he went in and stood for a long time
gazing down at her. Then removing his own cloak
he gently spread it over her to protect her from the
chill of the night air, and returned to his silent
watch. Early the next morning they entered the
harbor of Gaeta, and were met at the landing by
Maria Theresa and her children with Father Borelli,
her confessor. Francis had consulted this priest
some months before as to the advisability of granting
his subjects a more liberal form of government, and
Father Borelli had merely echoed the views of the
deceased King, declaring that such a course would
only hasten a revolution, and warning him against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are right,&rdquo; Francis answered, &ldquo;but
fear it will be impossible for me to follow your
advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Your Majesty may perhaps remember this
day as the last on which I shall kiss the hand of a
King of Naples,&rdquo; returned the priest.</p>
<p>This conversation now recurred to them both, as
Borelli came forward to greet the King, kissing his
hand again and again with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Francis, with a melancholy smile,
&ldquo;do you remember what you said to me on St. John&rsquo;s
Day at Portici?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Borelli, &ldquo;even though
you should no longer be a King on earth, you may
yet become a saint in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Francis and Maria Sophia had no sooner left the
capital than a deputation was sent out to welcome
the liberator, while the former minister of foreign
affairs prepared an address to Garibaldi, declaring
that Naples was waiting with impatience to greet
him as the deliverer of Italy, and lay the fate of the
kingdom in his hands. They did not have long to
wait. The popular hero hastened his advance, and
arrived so quickly that there was barely time to prepare
for his reception. There was little sleep that
night in Naples, and the first rays of the morning sun
found the whole city astir. The principal thoroughfares
were thronged with men, most of them armed,
for fear of a reactionary movement. Windows,
balconies, even the roofs of houses were crowded
with spectators. Everything conspired to surround
Garibaldi and his men with a halo of romance.
Their picturesque garb, rapid conquests, and fiery
proclamations appealed to the imagination of the
hot-blooded southerners and roused them to wildest
enthusiasm. Guards had been placed at all the
exits of the railway station, where a large number
of prominent citizens had assembled to welcome the
hero. Presently a bell was heard, and a train drew
in. A great shout arose; but it was found to contain
only a band of foreign mercenaries who had recently
joined the victorious party. At noon another bell
sounded, and Garibaldi&rsquo;s approach was signalled.
The train stopped. Thousands of voices joined in
the shout of &ldquo;Long live Garibaldi!&rdquo; as two men in
red shirts appeared. They were embraced with such
vehemence by the excited Neapolitans that one of
them, who was taken for Garibaldi, barely escaped
alive. The great man himself had gone out by another
door, however, and when this was discovered
there was a general stampede to find him. This
time they were successful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Garibaldi&rsquo;s entry into Naples was as brilliant and
spectacular as the rightful sovereign&rsquo;s departure had
been quiet and unnoticed. A huge national flag
had been unfurled, bearing the arms of the house of
Savoy, with the white horse of Naples and the lion
of Venice; and Garibaldi kissed this with tears rolling
down his cheeks, declaring, &ldquo;Soon we shall all
be united brethren!&rdquo; while many of the spectators
also wept. He and a few of his companions then
entered the open carriages that were waiting to
convey him to the city. Eight thousand of the royal
troops had been left in the citadel and a few outposts
to maintain order; but they had received no orders
to resist the revolutionists, and even had such been
the case, it is doubtful if they would have obeyed, so
carried away were they by the tide of popular enthusiasm,
as, amid deafening cheers, the waving of hundreds
of tri-colored banners and showers of blossoms
from every window, Garibaldi entered in triumph
the gayly decorated city, while even the skies seemed
to share the joy of the people and smile upon the
liberator of &ldquo;La Bella Napoli.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>He refused to occupy the royal palace which had
been so lately vacated by the sovereigns, but drove
on to a smaller one, generally used for the accommodation
of foreign princes, where he took up his
quarters. Vast crowds surged about the building,
shouting for the Dictator, till at length one of the
revolutionists appeared on a balcony, then another,
and finally the hero himself. Again a storm of
cheers broke forth, and, unable to make himself
heard above the uproar, he leaned over the iron
railing and gazed down at the throng below. His
usually ruddy face was pale with emotion, and
wore a look of sadness curiously in contrast to
the feverish joy of his admirers; but there was a
gleam in his eye that betrayed the fires that glowed
within. He lifted his hand to command silence,
then began in tones so clear and distinct that not
a syllable escaped the ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neapolitans! This is a solemn and memorable
day. After long years of oppression under the yoke
of tyranny, you are to-day a free people. I thank
you in the name of all Italy. You have completed
a great work, not only for your countrymen but for
all mankind, whose rights you have upheld. Long
live freedom! the dearer to Italy, since she, of all
nations, has suffered the most. Long live Italy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shout was taken up by thousands of throats
and, their &ldquo;Viva Italia!&rdquo; could have been heard from
one end of the city to the other.</p>
<p>That afternoon Garibaldi visited the cathedral
and was greeted with even greater enthusiasm than
in the morning. At night every house was illuminated,
and a torch-light procession paraded through
the principal streets, which were filled with excited
throngs rushing about, every man with a flag in one
hand and a sword or a knife in the other, shouting
and embracing one another for joy. Garibaldi was
the idol of the hour, and Naples was his completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>But here and there were still a few who remained
loyal to the reigning family and were anxious as to
their fate. Francis, in his haste, had neglected to
remove his private fortune of eleven million ducats&mdash;the
dowry Queen Maria Christina had brought with
her from Sardinia&mdash;from the Bank of Naples where
it was kept. When Garibaldi learned this he sent
for the man to whom the receipt had been entrusted,
an officer of the royal household named Rispoli,
and forced him to give up the document, which, afterward,
he handed over to the new government.</p>
<p>Poor Rispoli, who was devoted to his master, was
so overcome at being deprived of his trust that he
was stricken with apoplexy and died the following
day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Siege of Gaeta</span></h2>
<p>It is probable that Francis at the time of his
departure from Naples had no definite ideas as
to how far he should offer resistance to the
course of events. His friends urged him to wait
quietly till the first wave of enthusiasm had passed,
hoping he might then return to the throne as a member
of an Italian confederation. From Gaeta he went
with his brothers to Capua, where their presence did
much to restore unity among the royal troops and
revive their sinking courage, and where he was
speedily joined by all who had anything to gain by
adhering to the Bourbon cause or were too deeply
compromised to venture to remain in Naples under
the new regime. A much more valuable addition
to the King&rsquo;s forces, however, was a large number
of volunteers from southern Germany, who had
hastened to the aid of their fair countrywoman,
and to whose valor it was largely owing that they
were able to hold out so long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>The arsenal and other stores in Naples had fallen
into the hands of the enemy; but after Francis had
collected and organized his troops beyond the Volturno,
he found himself with fifty thousand well
provisioned and equipped men at his command.
Fired now for the first time with true martial spirit,
he determined to cut his way through Garibaldi&rsquo;s
forces to Naples, where, he was assured by secret
agents, the fickle populace would welcome him
back with open arms. On the first of October,
at daybreak, accordingly, the attack was begun;
but the royal troops were defeated and driven back
across the Volturno, the gates of Capua being thrown
open at five o&rsquo;clock that afternoon to admit the
fugitives.</p>
<p>Victor Emanuel had already determined to take
a hand in affairs, although Naples had voted unanimously
for the annexation of the Two Sicilies to an
&ldquo;Italia una,&rdquo; and was by this time well on his way
thither to assist in the reorganization of this new
portion of his domains. The news of his approach
spread terror and despair among the King&rsquo;s forces;
but Francis and his generals decided to await the
enemy in a strong position on the further bank of
the Garigliano, where on the twenty-eighth of October
they were fortunate enough to repel an attack. But
the advantage was a brief one. Capua soon had
to be abandoned and, led by Victor Emanuel himself,
the Piedmontese crossed the Garigliano, forcing the
Neapolitans to retire within the shelter of Gaeta.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>This town, often called from its location the
Gibraltar of Italy, is one of the most strongly fortified
places on the peninsula, and has played a prominent
part in the wars of southern Italy. The Bay of Gaeta
not only compares well with the gulf of Naples in
beauty, but as a harbor is even better adapted to
commerce, being both larger and deeper. The town
is situated some sixteen miles from Naples, ten
from Capua, three from the boundaries of what
were then the Papal States, and seventeen from
Rome; forming with San Germano and Capua a
trio of defences capable of offering a long and stout
resistance.</p>
<p>Gaeta at this time had a population of about
fifteen thousand. It was a gay and picturesque
little town, irregularly but not unattractively built,
with well-paved if somewhat steep and narrow streets.
Tradition points to a neighboring grove as the spot
where Cicero was murdered by Antony&rsquo;s orders; and
between the citadel and the shore are some ruins
called by the people the tower of Roland, where a
friend of the Emperor Augustus was buried. The
town and the citadel are situated on two rocky
heights, separated by a steep cleft, the greater part
of the town occupying the southernmost of these,
while on the northern and much the larger one, rises
the citadel with its fortifications. Both are practically
inaccessible from the sea, while the west side
of the neck of land, that connects the mainland with
the outer point, also falls away steeply. Small
villages line the shore; and still farther to the south,
where the coast recedes so deeply that the bay lies
between it and Gaeta, is the town of Mola, where
the Piedmontese established their headquarters. It
would seem that Victor Emanuel&rsquo;s generals, made
over-confident by the easy victories they had met
with thus far in the Kingdom of Naples, scarcely
looked for any serious resistance here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>But supported by a French fleet which protected
the coast, by the presence of a well equipped and
disciplined army, and above all by his heroic wife,
Francis had at length determined to hold out in
spite of everything. In the citadel, besides the King
and Queen, were Maria Theresa with her five sons
and four daughters, the youngest of whom was not
yet three years old; the King&rsquo;s two uncles, the
Prince of Capua and the Count of Trapani; a few
faithful friends who had followed their sovereign,
and all the diplomatic corps, with the exception of
the English and French ambassadors, who had received
explicit orders from their Governments to
remain in Naples to report what was passing there.
All communication between Francis and the Emperor
Napoleon, therefore, had to be carried on through the
French admiral.</p>
<p>In spite of their recent experiences, the royal
family did not seem to realize at first the seriousness
of the situation. Gaeta had a garrison of twenty-one
thousand men, and the citadel was well supplied with
ammunition, while provisions for the army could
easily be obtained from the Papal States, through
the ports of Terracina and Civita Vecchia. The
Count of Trapani was in nominal command, but the
real leader of the defence was General Bosco. At
the time of his surrender to Garibaldi in Sicily, this
able officer had sworn not to take up arms for six
months; but this period had now elapsed, and his
return inspired the royal family with hope and confidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>On the thirteenth of November, 1860, the bombardment
of Gaeta was begun by the Piedmontese,
whose fire was vigorously returned from the citadel.
A week later the dowager Queen retired to Rome
with her younger children, and on the same day the
diplomats took their departure, all except the
Spanish ambassador, Bermudez de Castro, who was
a personal friend of the King. Even the Archbishop
of Gaeta deserted the sinking ship, though his place
should have been now, more than ever, with his flock.
Francis tried to persuade Maria Sophia to leave him,
and go to her home in Bavaria while it was yet
possible, but she absolutely refused. More closely
drawn to her husband in this time of danger than
ever before, she announced her firm intention of
remaining with him to the last, even though abandoned
by all the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Europe had held but a poor opinion of Francis
the Second during his short reign. His weakness
and cowardice had been openly criticised; while in
Naples itself he had been variously nicknamed
&ldquo;Bombino,&rdquo; &ldquo;Franciscillo,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Il Re Imbecile.&rdquo;
But in misfortune all his better qualities came to
the surface. At Gaeta, no longer distracted by conflicting
counsels, he became firmer and more manly,
while his readiness to sacrifice all personal feeling
to what he believed to be his duty, and his generosity
toward those who should have been his foes, could
not but command respect. For example, two Piedmontese
merchantmen took refuge in the harbor
of Gaeta one terribly stormy night; but instead of
seizing them and their cargoes, as would have been
his right, he permitted them to leave the bay the
next morning, unmolested. He was constantly visiting
the outworks, inspecting the work, and doing
his best to keep up the courage of his men, in which
he was bravely assisted by his two elder half-brothers;
but the Queen surpassed them all in courage, scorning
every danger and discomfort and looking death
calmly in the face. Every day and often at night
she visited the hospitals, carrying food, medicines,
and fruit, doing all she could to relieve the sufferers,
and shrinking from no wound, however terrible.
Once during the illness of one of the Sisters of Mercy,
Maria Sophia took her place as nurse, and though
shells were falling so thick about the hospital tent
that her life was in constant danger, she refused to
leave her post. The soldiers were always rejoiced
to see her and would follow her about with their eyes
in the most adoring way. They gloried in their
beautiful, spirited young Queen, dashing about on
her horse from one to another of the hastily improvised
hospitals that were set up on the different
batteries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The Piedmontese noticed that at the sound of a
certain bell there always seemed to be some commotion
in the citadel of the besieged city, and curious
to know the meaning of it, some officers in one of
the nearest outposts fixed their field-glasses on the
fortress at that particular time. Much to their
surprise they discovered a young woman in the
Calabrian costume, moving about among the guns
and encouraging the artillerymen, quite regardless
of the storm of shells that was falling about her.
It was Maria Sophia, making her daily visit to the
so-called &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Battery&rdquo; to watch the firing
from there, and a striking picture she made in her
long cloak and Calabrian hat, gay and smiling as
ever, glorying apparently in danger, and careless of
her own fate.</p>
<p>It had been agreed that a black flag should be
hoisted while the Queen was making her rounds
among the wounded, and the sign was at first respected
by the enemy, but Maria Sophia herself paid
no attention to it as she rode calmly about her
business even in those fortifications exposed to the
heaviest fire. One day a bomb fell so close to her
feet that she would certainly have been torn to
pieces had not an officer seized her in his arms and
swung her behind a projecting wall. Another day,
while standing in one of the window embrasures in
the citadel, talking with the Spanish ambassador, a
shell burst so near that the window panes were
shattered and the Queen&rsquo;s face was cut by the flying
glass. But she only laughed, saying, &ldquo;It is unkind
of the enemy to leave me nowhere in peace. They
have just driven me from one place, and now will
not let me stay here, either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you have had your wish granted,
madame,&rdquo; replied the Ambassador, &ldquo;you wanted
to see a ball as close as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I also wished for a slight wound,&rdquo;
added the Queen gayly.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>From Gaeta Francis had issued another proclamation
to his subjects, protesting against the new
order of things, and avowing his good faith toward
them and the constitution he had granted them,
in spite of all that had happened; but though widely
distributed, it was powerless to stem the current of
events. As we have seen, the King had lost many
opportunities of securing an advantage at the beginning
of the war. By retreating to Gaeta he was
placed in the curious position, for a commander, of
having cut himself off from two-thirds of his army.
He had given orders for the majority of these to slip
away across the Roman borders, hoping they might
be reassembled later, to form the nucleus for an uprising
in the Abruzzo Mountains. Reports, however,
of the terrible treatment received by prisoners at
the hands of the Piedmontese so alarmed the soldiers
that they made no attempt to escape till it was too
late, and the few that did reach Roman territory
were promptly disarmed. The French fleet, lying
in the Bay of Gaeta, had proved of inestimable value
in protecting the city from attack by sea. The
friendly attitude of the Admiral also made it possible
for the King&rsquo;s friends to furnish him with provisions,
while the supply ships carried many of the Neapolitan
troops away from Gaeta, landing them at Civita
Vecchia and Terracina. In this way the garrison
was reduced to fifteen thousand men; but even so,
the food supply soon began to fall short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>As early as the twenty-second of November, a
journalist wrote in his diary that provisions of all
kinds had doubled in price, and the situation grew
worse and worse as time went on. Rice, beans, even
bread, were almost impossible to obtain, and macaroni
and potatoes were sold for thrice their usual
value. Fish and meat were to be had only by the
officers in small quantities and of the poorest quality.
Then an epidemic of typhus fever broke out, which
soon filled every bed in the hospitals. The King
and Queen did all in their power to obtain nourishing
food for the sick and wounded, sending fish and
other delicacies procured for their own table to the
Sisters of Mercy to be distributed in the hospitals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Capitulation</span></h2>
<p>The siege of Gaeta lasted from the thirteenth
of November, 1860, to the thirteenth of
February, 1861, a space of three months.
With the new year it was pushed with redoubled
vigor. Both town and citadel were exposed to
incessant fire, and the noise was so deafening that
people had to scream to make themselves heard.
Not a single building remained intact. Many lives
were lost by exploding shells or falling houses, and the
whole place presented a scene of utter destruction.
The Piedmontese have been accused of sparing neither
church nor hospital, and the sick and wounded, as
well as their nurses, were exposed to the same dangers
as the rest of the inhabitants. The Red Cross
Society was not in existence at that time; but
the terrible experiences of the wounded in the wars
of northern Italy the preceding year led to the formation
of that association three years later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The enemy&rsquo;s fire now began to be directed chiefly
against the citadel where the royal family were
known to reside, and the officers begged the King
and Queen to move to a place of greater safety. One
of the casemates of an adjoining battery was accordingly
prepared for their occupancy, and here in this
small damp vault they lived for the remainder of
the siege, with the princes, the few members of
the court who had remained loyal, and some of the
officers. The casemate was divided by thin wooden
partitions into a number of small chambers, each
containing a bed, one chair, and a small table. The
narrow passage connecting these cells was always
crowded with people waiting to speak to the officers
and servants who had long since laid aside all badges
of royal service.</p>
<p>A low door led to the square chamber occupied
by the Queen, which was furnished in addition with
a couch and a <i>prie-dieu</i>; a small recess adjoining
having been made into a dressing-room. As a protection
against shells or flying missiles, a heavy oak
beam had been placed diagonally across the tiny
window overlooking the street; a precaution which
made the room so dark a light had to be kept burning
day and night. The little air that penetrated
to the cell was thick with smoke and tainted with
foul odors, while the ceaseless thunder of cannon
directly above must have made it a far from pleasant
place of residence. Yet from this gloomy vault
Maria Sophia wrote her parents not to worry
about her, for under the circumstances she was
doing very well. She bore all these dangers and
hardships with the same cheerful courage she
had shown from the first, tending the wounded,
inspiring the soldiers by her presence among them
in the smoke of battle&mdash;the soul, in short, of the
defence, and a splendid example of bravery and fortitude.
Through the efforts of the French admiral,
a ten days&rsquo; truce was arranged, and the Neapolitans
hastened to take advantage of it to procure a supply
of provisions from Terracina and to strengthen their
batteries, while the officers tried to encourage the
garrison by reports of speedy assistance from without.
On the sixteenth of January the sound of
guns was heard again; but this time it was not those
of the besieging army, but of the French fleet which
had not yet left the harbor, although the Emperor
Napoleon had notified Francis that it would be impossible
for him to continue the neutrality he had
hitherto maintained. Decorated from deck to mast-head
with flags, the foreign squadron was saluting
the King in honor of his twenty-fifth birthday, the
last he was ever to spend within the boundaries of
his kingdom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Three days later the truce was declared at an end,
and in the beleaguered city all eyes were fixed
anxiously upon the fleet. Although there were
rumors in the air of its departure, the people still
hoped they might be false as so many others had
proved. About two o&rsquo;clock, however, smoke was
seen rising from one of the vessels, and it was soon
evident that the whole squadron was getting up
steam. One after another lifted anchor and began
to move; and an hour later the huge flagship, <i>La
Bretagne</i>, glided majestically past the lighthouse on
the outermost point of the harbor, leaving the last
of the Italian Bourbons to his fate. With the
French fleet, vanished the last hope of rescue; and
from this time until the end of the siege, nearly a
month later, Gaeta was completely cut off from the
rest of the world, and surrounded on all sides by the
enemy. With the increase of famine and sickness
the situation grew daily worse. Help from without
could no longer be looked for, and rumors of treachery
began to be heard among the troops. The
barracks were damp, the hospitals overflowing, and
they were tired of a struggle that could have but one
end. The King and his brothers worked bravely to
keep up the courage of the garrison, and the Queen
was untiring in her efforts to relieve the sick and
suffering; but even they had lost hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>All correspondence between Napoleon and King
Francis had ceased on the twelfth of December, but
about the middle of January a vessel arrived from
France bringing a confidential letter from the Empress
Eug&eacute;nie to Maria Sophia. In it she declared
frankly and without circumlocution that it would be
as well to abandon the defence of Gaeta which had
cost so many lives, since it would be quite useless
to look for aid from any European power&mdash;the latter
sentence underlined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>This left no room for misunderstanding. At last
the King realized that his cause was lost&mdash;that all
his wife&rsquo;s splendid energy and the loyalty of his
troops had been wasted in a hopeless struggle. On
the twenty-seventh of January he received a letter
from Napoleon informing him that the French corvette,
<i>La Movette</i>, had been prepared for the accommodation
of Their Majesties in case of the surrender
of Gaeta, and would remain in the Bay of Naples
awaiting their orders. The town was now only a
smoking heap of ruins. The explosion of powder
magazines had caused even greater destruction than
the enemy&rsquo;s guns, and the casemate in which the
royal family had taken refuge might be destroyed
at any moment should the siege be continued. The
garrison was reduced to twelve thousand men with
over twelve hundred in the various hospitals, most
of them victims of the epidemic of typhus which
had proved so fatal. Among those who had succumbed
already to the disease were four of the King&rsquo;s
generals and the priest, Father Borelli, who had
remained in Gaeta to minister to the sick and
wounded.</p>
<p>Francis hesitated no longer, but sent a message
to the Piedmontese commander-in-chief requesting
an armistice to arrange articles of capitulation. The
terms were as follows: the garrison should retain
their military honors, but remain prisoners until
the surrender of Messina and the citadel Del Tronto.
When this had taken place, both officers and men
were to receive full pay with the choice of entering
the Piedmontese army or returning to their homes, all
who were honorably discharged to be pensioned. The
King and Queen, with the rest of the royal family,
were to be permitted to embark on the French vessel
which had been placed at their disposal, with as
many persons as they wished to take with them in
their suite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>The capitulation was signed on the thirteenth of
February, and the next morning at eight o&rsquo;clock
<i>La Movette</i> entered the Bay of Gaeta. The troops
were already drawn up in long lines, extending from
the casemate occupied by the King and Queen to
the landing; their tattered clothes and wasted forms
bearing witness to these last terrible months. Misfortune
had formed a close bond between the survivors
of the siege, and as the soldiers presented
arms to their sovereigns for the last time, their
cheeks were wet with tears.</p>
<p>An eyewitness of the departure of Francis the
Second and Maria Sophia from Gaeta has described
the touching scene. The King was in uniform, with
sword and spurs, the Queen wearing the round Calabrian
hat shown in the photograph taken of her at
that time. The deposed monarch was deadly pale,
and as gaunt as any of his soldiers. &ldquo;As for the
Queen,&rdquo; declared this observer, &ldquo;I could not see how
she looked, my eyes were so blinded with tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people had gathered in crowds, every face
showing traces of the suffering they had undergone;
but all seemed to forget their own troubles in the misfortunes
of their sovereigns. When the King and
Queen appeared, their emotion burst all bounds.
Many wept aloud as they pressed forward to kiss
the hand of the Queen with far greater warmth and
enthusiasm than was shown by the people of Bari
when they greeted her arrival as a bride on the shores
of Italy, two years before. Only two short years,
and yet how much had been crowded into them!
And how different that day from this!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Francis had already issued a parting proclamation
to his troops, thanking them in touching terms for
their devotion to him and to the honor of the army;
and as <i>La Movette</i>, flying the banner of the Bourbons,
glided slowly out of the harbor, a unanimous and
deafening shout of &ldquo;Evviva il Re!&rdquo; was their last
farewell to the exiled sovereign. The French on
the corvette welcomed their guests with royal honors,
the officers in full uniform and the sailors lined up
on deck to receive them. With the King and Queen
were the Counts of Trani and Caserta and three of
the Neapolitan generals. During the journey from
Gaeta to Terracina, Francis and his brothers showed
the greatest calmness, conversing cheerfully with
their suite, and the French officers could not refrain
from expressing their admiration at the King&rsquo;s dignified
acceptance of his fate. Maria Sophia had
remained alone on the after deck, leaning over the
railing, her eyes fixed on the cliffs of Gaeta. The
smiling landscape seemed an irony of her mood. A
gloomy sky would have been more suited to the
thoughts that filled her bosom. She remembered
with what noble aims she had come to this new land,
what fine resolutions to share in all works for promoting
the welfare of the people over whom she had
been called to rule&mdash;and what had been the result?
Even her labors at Gaeta had been in vain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>As <i>La Movette</i> passed the battery &ldquo;Santa Maria,&rdquo;
a royal salute was fired, and soon after the corvette
rounded the point and Gaeta was lost to sight. The
crew hauled down the Bourbon lilies and hoisted the
French tri-color&mdash;Maria Sophia was no longer a
Queen. She turned away with a chill at her heart.
The deck was empty and a cold wind had suddenly
arisen, banishing the warmth of the sunshine and
sending a shiver through her from head to foot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">After the Fall of Gaeta</span></h2>
<p>The news of the fall of Gaeta was hailed with
joy by the fickle Neapolitans, who seized the
occasion as a welcome excuse for more
parades and festivities, with dancing and singing
from morning till night. The day after the departure
of Francis and Maria Sophia, the garrison evacuated
the town. Officers and soldiers laid down their
arms before the walls of the citadel, and the fortifications
were occupied by the Piedmontese. Soon
after, the citadel Del Tronto opened its gates to
Victor Emanuel&rsquo;s troops, and with the surrender of
Messina on the first of March, the Bourbon lilies
disappeared from southern Italy.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth of February, the exiles landed at
Terracina, heavy at heart, and were escorted by a
company of French dragoons to Rome, where they
took up their residence in the Palazzo Farnese as
guests of Pope Pius the Ninth. Maria Sophia was
not a devout Catholic like her husband. She had
not wished to go to Rome, and found no comfort in
the Holy Father&rsquo;s friendship. The dowager Queen
was also living in Rome with her children, and the
close companionship into which the exiles were thus
forced by circumstances did not tend to improve the
relations between the ex-Queen and her mother-in-law.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>In times of trouble we naturally turn to our kin
for sympathy, and Maria Sophia was seized with
desperate longing for her mother and her Bavarian
home. Early in April, therefore, she set out for
Possenhofen, accompanied by General Bosco. The
two years she had spent in Naples had been far from
happy. She returned a queen without a crown,
deprived of all save honor. But the familiar scenes
and faces, and above all the comfort of pouring out
her heart to the strong, noble mother, who had suffered
so much herself, restored her courage, and she
soon became her cheerful, lively self once more, her
eyes sparkling with animation, full of spirit and
energy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>The young Queen&rsquo;s heroic behavior during the
defence of Gaeta had taken Europe by storm. Her
praises were on every tongue, and the beauty, the
courage, the warm-heartedness of the &ldquo;Heroine of
Gaeta&rdquo; were lauded in prose and verse. She was
deluged with tokens of admiration and sympathy,
among which were a gold laurel wreath from the
princesses of Germany and a sword of honor from
the women of Paris. The dowager Queen, Maria
Theresa, had not yet given up hope that she and her
children might return to Naples. Since Francis the
Second had proved himself incapable of maintaining
his place on Ferdinand&rsquo;s throne, she was more determined
than ever that her own eldest son should
occupy it; and in order to prevent any opposition
on the part of the Wittelsbach and Hapsburg families,
she succeeded in arranging a marriage between
the Count of Trani and Maria Sophia&rsquo;s sister
Mathilde soon after the arrival of the exiles in Rome,
neither of the young people&rsquo;s wishes in the matter
having been consulted in the least. Maria Sophia
returned to Rome after a month&rsquo;s stay with her
parents, and in May the bridegroom went to Munich
to meet his unknown bride. This prince was far
more attractive than his stepbrother in outward
appearance, having a frank, winning manner and
the utmost propriety of behavior. The wedding was
put off for a month, that the young people might
become better acquainted, the Count accompanying
the ducal family to Possenhofen, where he occupied
a neighboring villa on Starnberg Lake.</p>
<p>On the sixth of June, 1861, the ceremony took
place in the ducal palace at Munich, and the next
morning the newly married pair set out on their
wedding journey, escorted as far as Z&uuml;rich by the
bride&rsquo;s parents and sisters. At Marseilles a Spanish
warship was waiting to convey them to Civita
Vecchia, where they were warmly welcomed by the
ex-King and Queen of Naples, who accompanied
them back to Rome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Immediately after the fall of Gaeta, Francis had
despatched a letter to the Emperor Napoleon, thanking
him for the friendly interest he had shown and
expressing his appreciation of the courteous treatment
he and his wife had received from the officers
of <i>La Movette</i>. As yet the exiled sovereign scarcely
knew how his position was regarded by the European
powers; Victor Emanuel had already assumed
the title of King of Italy, and this moved Francis
to issue a circular urging them to discountenance any
pretensions on the part of the King of Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether he had at first any idea of
continuing the struggle, but he had no sooner arrived
in Rome than he became the centre of a counter
revolution planned by the Legitimist and Papist
party, the object of which was to make Naples again
an absolute monarchy, this being regarded as the
surest safeguard of the Pope&rsquo;s temporal power in
Rome. The dowager Queen contributed a large
share of her property to aid this undertaking, and
Francis himself gave all he could spare of the little
he had been able to retain of his private fortune.
But all in vain. The attempt was unsuccessful
and the Bourbon cause in Italy hopelessly lost.</p>
<p>Maria Sophia took no part in these efforts to recover
the lost crown. She had no confidence in her
husband&rsquo;s ability and strongly disapproved of her
mother-in-law&rsquo;s intrigues. As Queen of the Two
Sicilies she had boldly put aside everything that
interfered with her personal liberty; but under these
changed conditions and the protection of the papal
power she had no longer the right to assert her independence
or resent the elder woman&rsquo;s jealous opposition.
The monotony and inactivity to which she
was doomed in Rome were torture to her energetic
spirit, and she became nervous and irritable. By
way of retaliation and diversion she resorted to all
sorts of tricks and foolish pranks, which enraged her
mother-in-law and were little becoming a queen on
whom the eyes of Europe had been so recently fixed
with admiration and respect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>But this unnatural life had much more serious
results also. Meeting, as she constantly did, men
far more clever and attractive than the ex-King of
Naples, it was not strange that the latter should
have suffered in comparison, although, had he shown
his love for her in the early days of their married life,
she might still have preferred him to others. Her
husband&rsquo;s apparent coldness, however, had chilled
the warmth of her impulsive nature and turned her
affections back upon herself. With such a temperament
and capacity for love, these pent-up emotions
could not fail to find an outlet sooner or later. A
Belgian officer won her heart; and Maria Sophia,
full of life and ardor, forgot her dignity as Queen,
remembering only that she was young, a woman
desperately craving affection, alone in a dull, joyless
court, where the life was intolerable to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Less than a year after the heroic defence of Gaeta
it was said that the ex-Queen of Naples was suffering
from a disease of the lungs, and much alarm was felt
for her health. Early in the Summer she left Rome,
accompanied by the Count and Countess of Trani,
and went to Possenhofen, where the family was once
more reunited. Fate had not dealt kindly with the
Wittelsbach sisters. It was no secret that the Empress
of Austria&rsquo;s happiness was wrecked and her
health deranged, and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne of Thurn and Taxis had
fared little better. Elizabeth&rsquo;s marriage to Francis
Joseph had crushed her ambitious hopes, and the disappointment
had embittered her whole life, although
it had made no difference in the affectionate relations
between the sisters, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne having left her own
home to accompany the invalid Empress to Madeira.
Mathilde of Trani had been married only a year; but
the temperaments of the Count and Countess were
totally unsuited to each other. The young couple
had no permanent place of residence, no prospects
for the future, and the present was full of difficulties.</p>
<p>It was generally known that the climate and life
in Rome had seriously affected the health of the ex-Queen
of Naples; but a mother&rsquo;s sharp eyes soon
discovered that there was a deeper source of trouble.
This daughter, who had inherited all her father&rsquo;s
brilliancy and charm, was especially dear to the
Duchess Ludovica, and as she had always shared her
child&rsquo;s joys, she now comforted her in her hour of
despair. Early in August Maria Sophia left Possenhofen
for a sojourn at the baths of Soden, which it
was hoped would benefit her health, and after a
visit to her eldest sister at Taxis, returned to Bavaria
with her mother and the Empress Elizabeth. Francis
still loved his wife deeply, in spite of the blow his
faith in her had received, and both he and her own
family tried to persuade her to return to him; but
her health was still so poor she had little wish to
expose herself again to the climate of Rome. In
October she retired to an Ursuline convent at Augsburg,
much against the wishes of her family, who
feared it would appear to the world like a permanent
separation from her husband. They begged her at
least to come to Munich and live; but the quiet
convent life suited Maria and she refused to leave
her peaceful retreat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Next to the Duchess Ludovica, her most frequent
visitor at Augsburg was Queen Marie of Bavaria,
who had always been her closest friend, and it was
she who finally persuaded her cousin to exchange
the convent for a residence in Munich. In January,
1863, Maria Sophia moved to the Schloss Biederstein,
situated close to the English gardens and one
of the most beautiful spots in the Bavarian capital.
Again and again the ex-King of Naples made offers
of reconciliation, and at length his patience and devotion
touched his wife&rsquo;s heart. Possibly, also, her
eyes were gradually opened to the silent martyrdom
he, on his own part, had endured so long and which
she at the time had little understood or appreciated.
It was not until two or three months later, however,
that she finally decided to return to Italy. On the
thirteenth of April she arrived once more in Rome,
where she was warmly welcomed by her husband
and all the friends of the exiled family, after an
absence of nearly a year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Royalty in Exile</span></h2>
<p>Of all the sovereigns of Europe, Maximilian of
Baden had been the most loyal champion
of King Francis&rsquo;s cause. Neither Garibaldi&rsquo;s
triumphant progress, nor Victor Emanuel&rsquo;s victories,
nor the unanimous shouts of six million people for
&ldquo;Italia una&rdquo; could reconcile him to the new state
of affairs. He had been ill for a long time, and in
the Autumn of 1863 his physicians recommended a
sojourn in the south. So strong was his feeling,
however, against the new ruler of Italy, that rather
than pass through any part of his dominions, he
travelled by way of Switzerland to Marseilles, and
there boarded a vessel that would land him in papal
territory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The voyage was terribly rough and the King
suffered so acutely with seasickness that it brought
on an attack of his old complaint. Fearful of the
consequences of continuing the voyage, his physician
declared he must be taken ashore at all costs;
but the sea was too high to permit of the vessel&rsquo;s
landing, so the suffering monarch had to be lowered
into an open boat on a mattress and rowed ashore
by two sailors. Fortunately, they succeeded in
reaching land safely near San Stefano, where they
were met by the French consul, and King Max, more
dead than alive, was cared for so attentively that he
was able to continue his journey to Civita Vecchia
by carriage the next morning, arriving in Rome the
following day. Here he took up his residence in
the Villa Mattei, and his health began to improve
at once.</p>
<p>Maria Sophia was overjoyed to see her cousin
again. She herself was far from well, and had been
urged by her physicians to leave Rome; but Max, to
whom she was devoted, begged her to remain, and
she yielded to his wishes. In December, however,
her condition became so alarming that Francis was
forced to leave with her at once for Venice, a change
of air being absolutely necessary if her life was to
be preserved. The ex-King realized at last that it
was out of the question for his wife to live in Rome,
and henceforth they spent only the winter months
there. In the purer air of Venice she soon began
to gain strength and was able once more to enjoy
her favorite recreations. The relations between
Maria Sophia and her husband had much improved,
and while he had no sympathy with her tastes, nor
was able to join her in her rides, he no longer opposed
her in the indulgence of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Meanwhile the Schleswig-Holstein affair had become
a burning question in Germany. King Frederick
the Seventh of Denmark had died, and in the
latter part of November news was received in
Munich of Prussia&rsquo;s protest against his successor,
the Duke of Augustenburg. Public feeling ran high,
and the issue of events was anxiously awaited.
Under these circumstances the people of Bavaria
felt the need of their sovereign&rsquo;s presence among
them and King Max was obliged to leave Rome.
Although so much improved in health that his physicians
held out hope of a permanent cure, he was
still too ill to travel. He suffered a relapse soon
after reaching home, and died three months later,
deeply mourned both by his subjects and his family.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In the Autumn of 1867 an epidemic of cholera
broke out in Italy. The dowager Queen insisted
on remaining in her Albanian villa, though all her
children had hastily left the country. Deserted by
her family and her court, the widow of Ferdinand
the Second fell a victim to the scourge. Even the
servants had fled, and the only person with her at
her death was an old Neapolitan nobleman who had
been a friend of her husband&rsquo;s. Although Maria
Theresa&rsquo;s star had long since set, he remained faithful
to the last, tending and caring for her while she
lay ill, and accompanying her body&mdash;the only
mourner&mdash;to its last resting-place in the neighboring
churchyard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The relations between Francis and Maria Sophia
had never been actually unpleasant; but after the
death of the Queen dowager, they became more
attached to each other. Together they made frequent
visits to their various relatives or entertained
them in Rome during the Winters. The Empress
Elizabeth especially was a frequent visitor. These
two sisters, as unlike in character as in their circumstances,
had never lost any of their sisterly
affection for each other. Maria Sophia was with the
Empress in Hungary when her youngest daughter,
Marie Valerie, was born in 1868, and had shared her
joy in that happy event. With it, however, was a
feeling of sadness for herself, childless and, in a way,
homeless. Children of her own would have given
life a new aspect to her, and she felt she would have
been a different woman. But it was not her way to
indulge in vain regrets. She had long been indifferent
toward the world; her only interest now was
in her dogs and horses, and she would spend whole
days in the saddle, riding the wildest and most ungovernable
animals. Once, on one of these rides,
she met with an accident, from the effects of which
she was long in recovering, and her husband&rsquo;s quiet
devotion during this time furnished a proof of his
affection for her that drew them still closer together.</p>
<p>Maria Sophia&rsquo;s joy was boundless when, on Christmas
Eve, 1869, after ten years of married life, she
gave birth to a daughter in Rome. Four days later,
the little princess was christened, Pius the Ninth,
who performed the ceremony himself, acting as
godfather, and the Empress Elizabeth as godmother.
She received the names Maria Christina Louisa
Pia, for her two grandmothers and the Holy Father.
But the happiness of the ex-King and Queen was
destined to be of short duration, for their only child
lived but three months. She died in the following
March, and was buried in Rome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The withdrawal of the French troops from
Rome in 1870 to take part in the war against
Germany, put an end to the temporal power of the
Popes. Pius the Ninth was forced to relinquish
the Quirinal to the same bold conqueror who had
deprived Francis and Maria Sophia of their kingdom,
and thereafter they had no permanent residence in
Rome. As long as the Duke and Duchess Max
lived, they spent the summers in Bavaria, travelling
about from place to place during the Winter. The
greater part of Francis the Second&rsquo;s property, some
twenty million lire, had been confiscated by the new
Italian Government, which offered to refund it on
condition of his formally renouncing all rights to
the crown he had already lost; but this he refused
to do. &ldquo;A man does not sell his honor,&rdquo; was his
unfailing reply. Eventually he was paid back his
mother&rsquo;s dowry; but the immense sum that King
Ferdinand had settled on his eldest son at the time
of his marriage to Maria Sophia was appropriated
by Victor Emanuel, as were the contents of the
royal palace. Many of the paintings and works of
art are still shown at &ldquo;Capo di Monte&rdquo; in Naples,
to the indignation of many of the sovereigns of
Europe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Although the climate of Rome had never agreed
with Maria Sophia, both she and her husband often
declared that they had never really known the
terrors of exile till they were forced to leave Italy.
Francis never quite gave up hope that some turn of
events would pave the way for his return to his own
and his father&rsquo;s throne; but the heroine of Gaeta
never looked backward. The pomp and show of
royalty had never appealed to her, and she indulged
in no vain regrets.</p>
<p>The lives of the Wittelsbach sisters had proved
a source of grief and anxiety to their parents.
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, left a widow in 1867, after ten years of unhappy
married life, had managed the vast estates
of the Thurn and Taxis family with great ability
during the minority of her eldest son, Maximilian.
This prince, a most promising youth, died in 1885,
at the early age of twenty-three, and the blow
almost cost his despairing mother her reason, while
the following year, Count Ludwig of Trani drowned
himself in one of the Swiss lakes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>The youngest daughter of the ducal pair, Sophie
Charlotte, had been first betrothed to Ludwig the
Second of Bavaria; but the King jilted his cousin
in the most heartless fashion, and she afterward
married Ferdinand d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on, an uncle of Louis
Philippe of France. Banished from France with the
rest of the house of Orleans, the Duke and Duchess
spent their time travelling from place to place, and
Sophie was sickly and discontented, a victim to fits
of melancholia. By his death on the fourteenth of
November, 1888, good Duke Max was spared the
tragedy of Mayerling, where his favorite grandson
and the hope of the Austrian Empire, Rudolf of
Hapsburg, met with a violent and mysterious death
three months later. On the twenty-fourth of January,
1890, the Duchess Ludovica was seized with
an attack of influenza at her palace in Munich,
which developed into pneumonia. The physicians
at once pronounced her condition serious on account
of her advanced age, and the absent daughters were
telegraphed for. Sophie was already in Munich,
as were the three sons. The next afternoon the
Duchess grew so much worse that the sacrament
was administered; but in spite of the evident approach
of death the indomitable old lady refused to
go to bed. She insisted upon remaining in the
reclining chair which she had occupied from the beginning
of her illness, and where she soon sank into
unconsciousness, passing away quietly at four o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, surrounded by children, grandchildren,
and great-grandchildren, at the age of
eighty-three. The death of the Duchess Ludovica
was an irreparable loss to her family. They had
leaned on her in joy as in sorrow, and as long as she
lived she had held them together, widely scattered
as they were, with a firm and loving hand. Her
children&rsquo;s troubles and pleasures had been her own,
and their devotion, her joy and reward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>After the funeral of the Duchess Ludovica,
Maria Sophia returned to Paris, where the
ex-King of Naples had bought a residence
some years before, and where they were living very
quietly, seeing no one but old friends or relatives.
Her grief at her mother&rsquo;s loss was deep and sincere,
and for a time she was inconsolable. For her it
meant the severing of all the old ties and associations;
and henceforth she rarely visited the home of her
childhood.</p>
<p>A few months later H&eacute;l&egrave;ne of Thurn and Taxis
died after a long and painful illness, at the age of
fifty-eight. The Empress Elizabeth had hastened
to her and was with her when she died, but none of
the three younger sisters were able to be present.</p>
<p>In the Autumn of 1894 the ex-King of Naples
went to the baths at Arco in the Tyrol for his health,
while his wife remained in Paris. Francis had suffered
for several years with an incurable complaint,
and it was reported that his illness had recently
taken a serious turn; but this had been denied.
Death came sooner than any one expected, however,
to the unfortunate monarch, for he expired on the
twenty-seventh of December&mdash;alone, as he had
lived. Maria Sophia started at once for Arco on
the news of his illness, but arrived too late to find
him alive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Not a flag was lowered in the kingdom of his
fathers to mark the death of Francis the Second
of Naples, nor was his body even allowed to rest in
the land he had loved. In all his vicissitudes, the
long years of exile, and the hours of loneliness and
pain, Italy had been ever in his heart. Through all
his wanderings he had been haunted by memories
of the blue skies and sunny gardens of his childhood
days. His love for his native land extended even
beyond the grave, for in his will he bequeathed a
million lire to charitable institutions in Naples and
Palermo.</p>
<p>Duke Karl Theodor and his wife, with several other
members of Maria Theresa&rsquo;s family, hastened at once
to Arco to comfort Maria Sophia and be present
at the ex-King&rsquo;s funeral. It took place on the third
of January, 1895, and was attended by a large number
of royalties and other distinguished personages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>In the bright Winter sunshine the body of Francis
the Second was borne to the cathedral where it was
to be laid to rest. The narrow streets were thronged
with black-garbed men and women, and bells were
tolled in all the churches, while the trumpets of the
two battalions of Austrian J&auml;gers sent by the Emperor
Francis Joseph, to pay the last honors to the deceased
sovereign, sounded a farewell. At the door
of the church the procession was met by the ex-Queen
with her sisters, Mathilde and Sophie, with several
of her sisters-in-law, and other noble ladies who
formed the band of mourners. The services lasted
five hours, and were conducted by the Archbishop of
Trent; but at last all was ended, the dim cathedral
was left silent and empty, and only the sound of tolling
bells echoed mournfully through the wintry air.</p>
<p>The life of Francis the Second of Naples was one
of renunciation. Little sympathy or affection fell
to his lot. He was arbitrary where he should have
been yielding, and yielding where he should have
been firm; yet during his short reign he was one of
the most conspicuous figures in European politics,
and he had carried a kingdom with him in his downfall.
He was a good man and a good Christian,
and, in spite of his shortcomings, a real hero; for
while his heart was bleeding, he bore his sorrows in
silence and hid his sufferings from the world.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Although Maria Sophia had never really loved her
husband, a close and sincere friendship had grown
up between them, and she truly mourned his death.
After the funeral she returned with her brother and
his wife to Munich, where for a time she occupied
her old residence, the Schloss Biederstein; but now
that she was alone the thought of living there was
unbearable to her.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>FRANCIS SECOND
<br />in his sixtieth year</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>The claims of the ex-King to the throne of Naples
passed at his death to Alfonzo, Count of Caserta;
and while Francis had left his wife a large sum of
money, the bulk of his fortune had been bequeathed
to this brother whose marriage had been blessed
with ten children. The residence in Paris occupied
by the royal pair had been included in this; and as
Maria Sophia wished to be free to live her own life,
she bought an estate at Neuilly-sur-Seine, where
she lives quite alone the greater part of the year.
She rarely goes to Bavaria, but spends a few weeks
each winter at Arco. It was her intention originally
to have her husband&rsquo;s body removed to her family
burial-place in Tegernsee; but the last King of
Naples still sleeps before the high altar in the cathedral
of the little Tyrolean town. This quiet spot
has grown dear to the ex-Queen, and she mixes
freely and pleasantly with the people who go there
for the baths. She is still a distinguished woman,&mdash;distinguished
in the best sense of the word,&mdash;with
much of that charm that is like a reflection of the
past. Most of her time, however, she devotes to
the real passion of her life, her farm, where she raises
thoroughbred dogs and horses. Maria Sophia is
not a recluse; but she lives in a world of her own,
and cares for animals more than for people. In
former days her sisters used often to visit her at
Neuilly, the Duchess d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on then living in Paris,
and the Empress Elizabeth and Countess of Trani
frequently stopping there on their journeys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>The portraits of these four sisters plainly show
their differences of character. Mathilde of Trani
is the picture of discontent and disillusionment;
Elizabeth is the mourner; Sophie d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on is resigned
and weary of the world, while Maria, unlike all the
others, looks bravely out at life, despite her years.</p>
<p>She accepted the decrees of fate with courage and
fortitude, and bore her troubles more philosophically
than her sisters, therefore she has kept her cheerfulness
and serenity, and much of her former beauty.
She is always active, for she still feels young. But
her solitary life and her preference for the society
of animals to people, show that the life of this gayest
and soundest of the Wittelsbach sisters has also been
a tragedy.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Three years after the death of the ex-King of
Naples, another terrible misfortune occurred in the
family. On the fourth of May, 1897, the French
capital was the scene of a most frightful catastrophe.
The ladies of the French aristocracy were holding a
bazaar for charity, in a building which had been
roughly and carelessly constructed, and lined with
booths in which many prominent society women
sold wares donated for the purpose. A kinematograph
had also been installed to add to the entertainment.
In the middle of the afternoon, when the
crowd was greatest, a lamp attached to this suddenly
burst, and in an instant the whole building was in
flames. The exits were insufficient and hard to
find, and scores of people perished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Among the most prominent of the workers was
Sophie, Duchess d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on, who was a devout
Catholic and had devoted the latter years of her
life almost entirely to charity. Witnesses of the
scene of horror who escaped with their lives have
told of the Duchess&rsquo;s heroism in attempting to save
others, forgetful of her own danger. One lady tried
to carry her out by force; but she broke away, and
dashing back into the flames, took her place in her
own booth again, calmly assisting in getting the
young girls into a place of safety.</p>
<p>All that night it was hoped that she, too, had
succeeded in making her escape. But the next day
a wedding ring, bearing the name of Ferdinand
d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on, was found in the ruins and all hope of finding
her alive was abandoned. Her body, burned
beyond all recognition, was afterward identified by
a dentist who had supplied her with some false teeth
shortly before. Maria Sophia was in Neuilly at the
time of the accident, and her appearance with the
Duke d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on, at the requiem mass held in memory
of the dead in the Church of St. Philippe de Rule, was
her last public appearance in the world. When the
Empress Elizabeth, who fell by the hand of an assassin
on the shore of Lake Geneva a year later, was
laid away in the vault of the Capucins at Vienna,
Maria Sophia was unable to be present. Only in
spirit could she bid farewell to this favorite sister,
under whose cold and reserved exterior had beaten
a warm and loving heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Many years have passed since the Rose of Starnberg
Lake was planted at the foot of Vesuvius, many
since Francis the Second&rsquo;s tottering throne collapsed,
burying the hopes of a lifetime. But time has
treated Maria Sophia gently. If she has wept
bitter tears, the world has seen no trace of them.
Her smile is still that of the beautiful young Queen
of Naples, and she has kept that youth of the heart
that never fades. But what her thoughts are as
she goes about among her pets, no one knows. Does
she still see Gaeta at times behind its dark, receding
cliffs? Perhaps, for it was there that she displayed
for the first and only time the gifts with which Providence
had endowed her, and the supreme moments
of life one does not forget.</p>
<p>The romance of Maria Sophia&rsquo;s life ended at
Gaeta: forced from the world&rsquo;s stage with all the
splendid promise of her youth unfulfilled, she has
never since taken part in the affairs of men. Yet
she is not morbid or unhappy. She looks back
upon her life without bitterness, and if her heart
has longings, it is not for her vanished crown and
sceptre.</p>
<p>The struggle for Italian unity has given place to
other and newer events in the world&rsquo;s history. The
Queen of Naples has hidden her royal honors under
the modest title of Duchess of Castro. When she
dies, an almost forgotten episode will be revived and
the &ldquo;Heroine of Gaeta&rdquo; recalled to the memory of
men; but only the gray-haired soldiers who knew
and served under the young Queen will remember
how gay and brilliant she was, will see her again in
all her fresh young beauty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Maria Sophia was a heroine but for a day; but
time has no power to touch her memory. Clothed
in the radiance of perpetual youth, she stands a
glowing figure in the annals of history.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
